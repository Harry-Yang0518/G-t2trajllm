As I started planning my upcoming Dec-Jan 2026 trip, I remembered my forgotten trip report draft. # Locations **Route:** Tokyo 8 days -&gt; Kyoto 6 days -&gt; Kurashiki 2 days -&gt; Hiroshima 2 days -&gt; Tokyo 3 days **Day trips:** Kamakura, FujiQ, Uji, Okayama, Nijigen no Mori (Awaji), Miyajima # Good parts * I saw a kpop idol in Ginza (Straykids Hyunjin). I‚Äôve never seen a celebrity in public randomly before so hot tip: if you see a huge crowd forming around a place, be nosy and find out what they‚Äôre there for. You never know who you‚Äôll see! * Random encounters during my trip: saw and talked to SHO the ‚ÄúI like sushi‚Äù guy with the gold Mercedes Benz, I also saw Akidearest (youtuber) walk past me at Sunshine city Pokemon center. Then we saw her chilling on the sidewalk on the way to the train station so I decided to greet her * We decided to do any stamp rally we came across to ‚Äì it made the visits to different places/train stations even more exciting * I was able to snipe some tickets to a Michelin 2-starred restaurant, Floril√®ge. This was a dining experience that I‚Äôd never forget. The dishes looked so beautiful. * If you‚Äôre trying to book popular restaurants like this through TableCheck, you literally have to secure your tickets within 30 seconds of release. I used Safari for the autofill. * To-ji Temple night illumination viewing during fall foliage ‚Äì for some reason, we started a line and just waited an hour or so before the 6pm opening. The stunning illumination was well worth the wait. We got a short moment of time when the place wasn‚Äôt filled with people, and we were able to get perfect shots without being shoulder to shoulder with someone for the view. * Kurashiki was the perfect follow-up to Kyoto. Just walking around near our accommodation to unwind, we went for ages without seeing a single person. This was the kind of calm that we needed in the middle of our trip. For dinner, we went to the closest izakaya open (a 15min walk lol). Though the owner and daughter were surprised to see 2 foreigners walk-in at 9:40pm, they were still quite friendly and welcoming to us. They even tried to include us in their conversation with the other 2 customers there. Definitely a core memory for me. * So much TWICE merch! Sunk too much yen into claw machines with laburis, bought a few tickets for Twice ichibankuji, got a ticket to the JYP Japan Popup store and experience trading photocards and postcards with other people outside the store. * My partner bought 20 tickets for a Naruto ichibankuji to get the top prizes and the final prize. He was so happy, but can‚Äôt say the same for the guy behind us lol. He walked away begrudgingly after realising my bf just cleared out the whole batch and he would have to buy from a new set. # Would revisit * Immersive Fort ‚Äì I 100% recommend if you‚Äôre also trying to learn Japanese like me. It was such a unique experience to be immersed in different themes/stories. * Tales of Edo Oiran is an absolute must and worth the additional cost to entrance fee. For me, the highlight was when I was able to go with the Oiran (main character) during one of the times that they‚Äôd split us into groups, and it was just me, this other Japanese guy, and her in this small room. We even acted and showed how concerned we were for her. I was such a happy little kid inside. My partner on the other hand didn‚Äôt enjoy it as much as I did as I had to translate what they were saying most times. * My partner was a big fan of Tokyo revengers at the time so we of course opted for the Tokyo Revengers: Immersive Escape. I love how the cast were not afraid to talk to us and help us solve the puzzles despite being foreigners. * I regret not going to the Alice in borderland and the Sherlock one, thus I must revisit on my next Japan trip. * FujiQ ‚Äì Despite having skill issue and somehow missing the stop leading to 6 hour delay in arriving here, it was still worth the trek to go here. We rode Eeejanaika 3 times in a row, spun around despite the freezing weather in Tentekomai Sky roller, rode the flight simulation ride with Attack on Titan theme, rode the tea cups with no one else around but me and my partner + spinning really fast, and ended the day with watching the sunset on the ferris wheel then grabbed some grilled fish on the way out. Worth the hassle, and I would visit again (but probably not for a day trip from Tokyo). * Nijigen no mori ‚Äì this was a bit of a hassle to get to for a day trip from Kyoto, though definitely not as bad as the Tokyo to FujiQ experience. What we enjoyed right away was how much quieter it was compared to other theme parks. My bf really enjoyed the Naruto park, while I had so much fun with the Godzilla zipline. Regretted starting Monster Hunter the field after sundown so we weren‚Äôt able to go around the park and properly enjoy the Field Exploration part. The park gets so dark as there‚Äôs only a few streetlamps.. We also stupidly missed the bus back to the station (we waited at the wrong stop) so we had to wait in the dark + freezing cold weather for a long time. Despite the mishaps, we‚Äôre still keen to revisit when they have new attractions. * Miyajima to hike Mt. Misen ‚Äì we were so excited to go up to the lookout at Mt. Misen, but not long into the trail (like 5 mins), we realised that the clothes we wore were definitely not for hiking + we were freezing. I would love to revisit Miyajima again and go around the island more leisurely. # Good finds * ICHIBAN at Shinbashi, Minato ‚Äì 150 yen per plate‚Äº how good. I also enjoyed how I was able to practice ordering in Japanese for each plate I had, rather than just grabbing off the conveyor belt. My partner and I really liked it that we went a second time. However, for some reason the chef puts so much wasabi in the tuna sashimi‚Ä¶ so we just avoided ordering tuna and tried pretty much all of the other ones on the menu. * I came across that milk shop in Akihabara station (found out shortly after that it‚Äôs lowkey famous) ‚Äì I got some pasteurised milk, it was good * Hakuhinkan Toy Park for the mini RC track ‚Äì this was such a fun 200 yen spend for me. Definitely recommend to stop by if you‚Äôre at Ginza. * This random restaurant at Uji that does a really good katsudon even though their main menu is soba. I will always think about you. * The cheese karaage kun at Lawson was so good I bought one pretty much everyday * Stellar garden sky lounge at The Prince Park Tower Tokyo - This was such a good last minute find by my BF. Although we didn't get a window table, we still thoroughly enjoyed the glittering Tokyo Tower while sipping \\[expensive\\] cocktails. # Meh parts * I loved Kamakura, but don‚Äôt even bother going to that really famous train rail part near Kamakurakokomae station. It was way too crowded‚Ä¶ * teamLab Borderless ‚Äì I‚Äôm just not a big fan of attractions with way too many people in a small area. Plus it got a bit too repetitive * I did enjoy the part where we were able to draw something and you could see your artwork swimming around after * Age3 at Ginza ‚Äì we bought 4 different flavours, tried and it was just meh * I was honestly pretty disappointed with the Kyoto part of my trip. Bus after bus kept arriving, each unloading big waves of tourists into the same small spots‚Ä¶ That one street in Arashiyama that was so packed with people you could barely even see the road‚Ä¶With Tokyo, you expect the crowds and chaos, and I‚Äôm totally fine with that. But Kyoto‚Ä¶ you go there expecting a bit of peace and tradition. The sheer volume of tourists really took away from the experience for me. I think part of it is also that I keep subconsciously comparing it to my first visit ten years ago, which felt so much more authentic and calm. Main tip: It‚Äôs completely okay to not have a detailed itinerary and just aim for 1 or 2 non-negotiable spots to visit. Exploring makes the trip so much better. However, please do learn from our mistakes (6 hour delay‚Ä¶) and plan your day trips travel better ü§°"}

I wanted to give my family a well-rounded tour around Kyoto and Tokyo. I didn‚Äôt initially want to travel in the summer but it was the only time we were all available. # 1. DAY 1 OSAKA TO KYOTO # i. Landed at KIX Airport, somewhat of a hectic arrival, staff were very rushed and required documentation that they ended up not needing. I saw instructions that allowed a group entry with the QR code but that was too complicated for them so I had to separate the QR codes in line. # ii. Once I finally exited customs, I was ready to use my Haruka One Way ticket to Kyoto which I purchased through Klook. This further complicated my arrival since instructions at the gate did not align with instructions on the Klook app. At first it seemed like I needed to pay for the entry fare using a PASMO card, then I needed cash to load the PASMO card, ultimately all I had to do was just scan the QR code on the ticket at the ticket gate to get to my train. # iii. The train dropped us off at Kyoto Station and from there we took the bus to our hotel, Hotel Resol Kyoto Kawaramachi Sanjo. This is my second time staying at the hotel, I highly recommend it since its fairly close to some of the more touristy spots in Kyoto and they have small but nice rooms with amenities. At this point the weather was humid and hot but I didn‚Äôt mind it too much, I saw some reports say here that it was unbearable but it was not the worst‚Ä¶yet. # iv. Once we settled in, I took my parents around to the river and to check out the shops nearby. Things close pretty early so we headed over to the konbini to get drinks and ice cream to cool down. # 2. Day 2 KYOTO # i. We were very lucky to arrive during the Gion Matsuri, the summer festival that takes place in Kyoto. The main streets were temporarily closed off to give space for the floats. This was really beautiful to watch and it looked like everyone was having a good time participating in it. There was some rainfall which didn‚Äôt really help with the heat but it was nice to be in. # ii. Took the family to Teramachi to check out some shops and good food, again I know this is a touristy spot but I figured it was a good place to show the family since it was their first time in Kyoto. We ate at Ichiran Ramen, solid as always and I try to go to it at least once during my trips since it never disappoints. # iii. At night we visited Fushimi Inari Shrine, I mostly like to go at night since tourists usually visit earlier in the day. Thankfully this was the case for us but the weather made it very difficult for us to keep going up. We made it up to the second entrance before we figured the walk would kill us in the weather. After that we called it a day, unfortunately this is where I noticed the summer heat was going to slow down the trip for me. # 3. DAY 3 UJI/KYOTO # i. This was our last full day in Kyoto, we took a train to Uji where we explored Uji Bridge and Byodoin Temple. This was my first time in Uji so I was able to slow down and take in the sights. Lots of shops that sold all kinds of matcha desserts and foods. The temple was really nice and had a small but fascinating museum with some national treasure such as the Temple Bell and statues of the Praying Bodhisattva. After the shop we ate some matcha ramen that was nearby, very delicious but I do think we over paid a bit. # ii. After this we went back to the hotel to cool down, the weather was just getting more and more difficult at this point. My parents are in their 50s and unfortunately I could tell they wanted to keep pushing but it was too difficult. # iii. We shopped around the local malls and went to the Nintendo Shop which was overrun with people. Its definitely true that tourism has gone up to levels not seen before. In my last few trips there was a lot of people but this summer was the most id ever seen. # 4. Day 4 KYOTO to SHIBUYA # i. We took the bus back to Kyoto Station to take the Shinkansen up to Shibuya. I figured all of us with luggage would be an issue in the bus but thankfully it wasn‚Äôt too bad. I bought the shinkansen tickets at the ticket machine and we made our way through. I did pay a little extra for reserved seats to ensure we were all together for the trip. # ii. We exited near the Shibuya Scramble and was shocked with the amount of people around. Again just like in Kyoto, way more tourism than what I‚Äôd seen before and unfortunately it was a bit overstimulating for my family since we had to deal with the heat and the large amount of people to get through. # iii. Thankfully our hotel wasn‚Äôt too far from the station exit, we stayed at Shibuya Tokyu REI Hotel. It wasn‚Äôt the best hotel id been at but it was located in a good area. # iv. We ate at a Rakeru that was nearby, not exactly Japanese food but it was great omurice that satisfied the whole family. Later on in the evening we went over to Shinjuku to check out Godzilla, I think this was a breaking point as the heat and all the walking led to some of my family members to stay in the hotel all day. # B. DAY 5 SHIBUYA/OTA # i. Woke up early to check out Yoyogi Park and had some breakfast at an Excelsior Caf√©, was surprised by how good the matcha latte was there. Will definitely get a small breakfast there again next time I go. I spent most of the day visiting family in Ota. # C. DAY 6 KAMAKURA/YOKOHAMA/SHIBUYA # i. We took a brief trip to Kamakura, just exiting the station there were a bunch of shops to look around. Lots of spots to get some souvenirs for people back home, this led us to Hase-dera and also to Kotoku-in Temple. I highly recommend Hase-dera, the temple was very nice and lots of cool photos to take here. I wanted to check out the beach but everyone was exhausted so we went back to Shibuya for a brief rest. # ii. After our rest we went to Yokohama, we checked out Chinatown and then we took the gondolas to head over past the waters and to get to the malls and to see the Ferris wheel. The sights were much nicer in the evening as all the lights turn on on the wheel and gondolas. I‚Äôd recommend coming closer to the evening, it was a nice break from Shibuya since the city felt much calmer. # D. DAY 7 SHIBUYA/SHIMOKITAZAWA # i. This was our last fully day in Tokyo so I tried to take it easy, we did some more shopping in Shibuya, visited Tower Records and Paris Miki. Had some great sushi at Uobei, my family was very impressed with the revolving sushi concept. # ii. Since we had some extra time I took us all to Shimokitazawa which was a bit of a mistake, things were closing down at the time we went and it wasnt really the vibe my parents were going for. # E. HANEDA AIRPORT # i. As it was our final day, I had the hotel hold on to our luggage as we walked around Shibuya. Rakeru was a favorite so some of the family went to eat there one last time and I had some fantastic ramen at Ramen Kairikiya. They served me a nice big bowl and it was the last draft Asahi I had in my trip, would go again if im around. # ii. We took the airport bus to the HND, tickets were purchased at the counter near the waiting area. Unfortunately our experience through customs was stressful again, I stupidly put liquids in our carryons and they had to open our luggage up and throw away our items. I just wish I would‚Äôve asked to put them in a single luggage to check it in instead. Also we forgot to return a portable wifi we had for a trip which cost us quite a bit in fees with the return. # F. Final Thoughts # i. When I do another family trip I will absolutely not go in the summer, I‚Äôve visited before in October and November which had the ideal weather for me. The summer heat really slowed us down and made us all cranky. Managing multiple day trips and thinking clearly was very difficult, I overestimated the heat at the start and then underestimated it in the final half. # ii. I should‚Äôve preplanned specific places to eat, I wasted time looking for restaurants. It‚Äôs easier to just find something in the moment when it‚Äôs just two people but a whole family of 6 needs to be a lot more meticulously planned. It‚Äôs hard to do things spur of the moment. # iii. Will plan to visit more areas that are easy going that don‚Äôt require as much walking and that aren‚Äôt such a hotspot for tourism. # iv. Also, I will never forgot to return a pocket wifi and I urge you all to also remember to return before crossing over customs. # v. Overall it was a challenging trip but I the positives outweighed the negatives and my experience will only help me avoid making the same mistakes in the future. # G. Recommendations # i. I‚Äôll be returning in February to head over to the My Bloody Valentine concert in Tokyo and I also plan to visit Sapporo. Hopefully this trip report can help you guys out so I‚Äôd love to receive some recommendations in Sapporo and also any places that id enjoy outside of some of the more popular cities I‚Äôve visited here. Thanks!"}

Here is an overview - We landed in Tokyo and immediately made our way to the Fujinomiya area as we had plans to climb Mount Fuji on the 11th August via the Subashiri trial. Sadly we had to alter our plans as a typhoon came in and it would have just been a dangerous (or at the very least, a very miserable) climb. We had to book a hotel on the hop back in Tokyo but we found one for a very reasonable ¬£155 for two nights. We then did the Shinjuku/Shibuya area and a walking tour which I‚Äôd defo recommend: https://www.airbnb.co.uk/experiences/1162458?viralityEntryPoint=2&amp;s=76 The host gave us some great restaurant recommendations too. We hit Osaka from August 13 and spent two days at this hotel: https://www.candeohotels.com/en/osaka-tower/. It was probably my favourite hotel on the whole trip. The rooftop onsen was beautiful and if you go late, chances are you‚Äôll have it all to yourself. Osaka was definitely one of my favourite stops as I loved the Dotonburi area. Lunch at Tempozan market place was a good shout too, some lovely okonomiyaki! We went to Nara for the day on August 15 and got to see the Festival of lights at Todaji temple in the evening which was very special. Then we travelled to Kyoto where we stayed for three nights at this Airbnb: https://www.airbnb.com/l/dOgObyiq The host was lovely and the place was super clean and accommodating. Nishiki market was a great place to explore and try some food. Wasn‚Äôt massively impressed with Pontocho alley but maybe that‚Äôs because it was raining at the time! We hiked the Fushimi Inari Shrine at sunset on one of the days which was amazing. The further up you go, the less people there are, so don‚Äôt worry about taking photos until you get further up in my opinion! We also did the Arashayama bamboo grove which to be honest I felt was a bit underwhelming as it‚Äôs just so full of people. We then did a day trip to Himeji before heading to Hiroshima. I found Himeji a bit of a letdown if I‚Äôm being honest. The outside is far more impressive than the inside. Hiroshima itself was a cool place. If you want a nice burger/nice bar, head to The Smith: https://www.instagram.com/the_smith_lab?igsh=YnljYXMxc3Vta2Ni The Peace Memorial Park was an impressive/sombre place. We spent two days in Miyajima as well. The view at the top of Mount Misen was amazing (if you have your hiking boots) and we also kayaked around the back with the Miyajima Kayak company. Would recommend them! https://miyajima-kayak.jp/en/ We then took a flight to Ishigaki ‚Äì what a beautiful beautiful place. If you can go, I‚Äôd recommend staying at MEGURU - https://meguru-hotel.com. It was clean, welcoming and the staff were amazing. It had real wellness-retreat vibes! During our stay in Ishigaki we hired mopeds on one day which was fun and just explored all the different beaches. Also did a day-trip to Taketomi which was a lovely place (and got very sunburnt!). After a week, we flew back to Tokyo where we did the Asakusa area on one day which was cool. If you‚Äôre looking for a capsule hotel recommendation, I couldn‚Äôt recommend these guys more: https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/resol-poshteldong-jing-qian-cao.en-gb.html We then managed to find some good weather to do Mount Fuji ‚Äì hiking up the Subashiri trail and staying the night at the 8th station‚Äôs Tomoekan hut - https://tomoekan.com/plan/english/ Nice place, warm, and good food! We then watched the sunrise the next day at 5am before hiking to the top and then descending. The next day, we were back on the plane home to the UK. Some thoughts - - The only bad meal I had the entire time I was in Japan was (ironically) the most expensive one! It was at Ginza Kojyu, a two Michelin starred restaurant in Tokyo. Actually have no idea how they have these stars as the food was so immemorable and the experience was just a bit bizarre. - August is a killer weather-wise. It‚Äôs so hot and humid and you were literally sweating five mins after going outside. I couldn‚Äôt change this as that‚Äôs when my partner is able to go away for extended periods due to his job but if you have more flexibility than me, defo go in more manageable conditions! - I‚Äôd be more flexible with planning the Mount Fuji climb if I were to do it again. Would perhaps have a couple days in mind and see how the weather is looking before travelling to Fujinomiya. - I‚Äôd take less toiletries. Every hotel we stayed in had toothbrushes, shower gels, pyjamas, creams, razors, etc, so we could have packed lighter. - A Suica card is essential! - Tabelog is a great website to see what decent restaurants are in your immediate area. - Aquarius and Pocari Sweat are godsend drinks on hot, humid days! There is always a vending machine to get one from. Would be more than happy to answer any questions!"}

But for us, that's exactly what it was. It was myself (44f), bf (56m), and three boys (18, 20, 21). We stayed in an apartment in Taito City, equidistant from Akihabara station and Okachimachi station. It was ideal for us: quiet, no tourists, and easy to get anywhere. We made heavy use of trains/subways and 15k yen on suica card was just the right amount. Most of the time, the boys went off on their own for the day while my bf and I did our own thing. We stayed together only for special trips. We had no itinerary so each morning we'd look at Google maps, see what was around, and head out. We did have two must-dos that we do in every country we can and that is to visit IKEA and Costco. So we went out to Shinmisato on one day and hit both of those. On Sunday, we all took a steam train to Chichibu and walked around there. So lovely!! The temple was amazing, and we had fun walking around so I could find as many Doko Ikubees as I could. We also took a day trip to Enoshima Island on another day which was wonderful. A few things: Yes it was hot and the last day we had heavy rains from the typhoon but it wasn't terrible. The boys actually went to Disneyland that day despite the rain. If you've had experience with the southeast US or even Missouri, it'll feel normal. We currently live in Idaho (I prefer snow and cold) and it seriously wasn't as bad as reddit makes it seem. We didn't even feel like we needed neck fans or parasols. We split up our flight to Tokyo and spent two days in Hawaii beforehand, which resulted in having zero jet lag when we got to Tokyo. Definitely worth it. We averaged around 11k steps a day, which is actually what we normally do on a workday at home. That's just the way it worked out for us (not done on purpose) so if you are worried about the redditors saying you have to be ready to do 20+k steps a day, thats them. You do you. No special shoes or anything. We wore our regular vans. If you have any experience with public transportation like in NYC or Paris (or even LA), Tokyo is just as easy or easier to figure out. It's bigger, but there are signs everywhere and its just lovely. We did notice that the \"rule\" about talking on trains was situational - morning commuter subways/trains were totally silent; mid-afternoon there was usually some talking. Just be aware of what the locals are doing and always use your library voice. Some of the main places we ended up going in Tokyo: Takashita street for one particular store Tsukiji Hongan-ji Temple and stayed for a \"service\" Tokyo station Kappabashi kitchen street which was underwhelming - ended up a few blocks away Round 1 Ikebukuro Metropolitan government building Shinjuku Gyoen Holy Resurrection Cathedral mAAch ecute Kanda Manseibashi Yaesu shopping mall Lots of book stores and stationary stores All in all, we loved it so much and it felt so comfortable and homey we are going to make more regular trips and explore more of Japan."}

I remember hating Osaka and Kyoto and finding them very overwhelming so I decided to do Tokyo then 2 days in Kanazawa and 2 days in Takayama. Kanazawa and Takayama were amazing. I wish Id spent 3 days in each. Travel wise, because we were a group of 7 with luggage we actually rented a minibus and road tripped for our four days. We essentially got a day and a half in each city. I got very lucky that there was no rain and I even got blue skies for most of the trip. I would not come back at the start of September though. 31 degrees is not ideal for walking. Having spent 5 days in Tokyo, Kanazawa was a relaxing breath of fresh air and Takayama felt like floating on a giant lily pad in a serene lake. Kanazawa: Day 1 we did museums. Then museums here are all small and take between 30 to 45 minutes to complete. Ninja Weapon Museum - Cute. Throwing Shiruken was fun. Dolls Museum - Surprisingly fun. Yoshiro Architecture Museum - The upper garden/tea room are gorgeous. And if you're into architectural history its probably a lot of fun. It was pleasant and nearby to the other museums so why not. Nomura ke Samurai Residence - Such beautiful stunninf gardens. Amazing. Kanazawa samurai town was so beautiful to walk in. You never knew what random garden you would find. Gelateria Ritorta was so good. I got melon flavour gelato and baci and it was delicious. They do many other intriguing flavours like fig, smoky nut, black sesame? I wont comment on food because I have the palate of a 5 year old but Vechio Albero does a sexy sexy seeeeexy margarita. The next morning we did Kenrokou En garden. There are no words to describe how truly stunning this park is. It just felt healing for the soul. This park was definitely worth visiting. Takayama A beautiful walkable samurai town. Hida Folk Village was stunningly beautiful. Would absolutely recommend visiting. Just walking through the town itself is such a fun experience. We randomly discovered a ninja cafe where we did blowdarts and a ninja VR game. The drive between Kanazawa and Takayama was 2 hours. We made a pit stop to Kurobe Gorge Railway which as pretty as it was...I wouldn't go again. Its a train that rides for 45 minutes through a gorge past 3 stops, has a 20 minute break and then makes its way back. The views are in the first 15 minutes of the train ride. The remaining 30 minutes are mid. It was an experience but not one I would recommend trekking out for. Wanted to share this for anyone who might benefit from it."}

As a way of saying thanks to everyone on this sub I'm posting a \"quick\" report on our 18 day trip. Me and my gf, both mid thirties from Italy. Hope you find it useful, feel free to ask any questions! * **Mon 11:** arrival at Fukuoka late afternoon, quick stroll along the river and dinner at yatai, there were only a few even though it was a national holiday. Ok ramen, great grilled mentaiko! * **Tue 12:** shinkansen to Hiroshima, train to Miyajima. Itsukushima shrine, then mt Misen then Daishoin. Train back to Hiroshima to see the atom dome, okonomiyaki dinner and train to Onomichi. Quick stroll to see Onomichi temples from outside at night. * **Wed 13:** Shimanami Kaido to Imabari. We stopped at Kosanji and did a detour to Oyamazumi shrine, plus a quick swim. Get the electric bikes if you want to see more stuff, and use them on max! Yakiniku at Imabari near the station for dinner. * **Thu 14:** Train to Matsuyama. Matsuyama castle via the Ninomaru (on foot) then took the ropeway down, then Dogo Onsen tour and private bath at the annex. Wanted to see the cave tunnel at Ishiteji but it closes at 16:00 so we missed it. Train to Marugame, izakaya dinner since it was late, great udon! * **Fri 15:** we decided against getting up super early to go to Kotohira and instead went directly to Takamatsu. Visited Ritsurin without rushing, then train to Tokushima for Awa Odori. Amazing experience. We had tickets for the show at Sansan at 20.20, so much fun. Stayed at an AirBnB (only place available when we booked). * **Sat 16:** early train to Takamatsu then Okayama. Stopped for Korakuen. Train to Himeji, managed to get a spot on the official english tour at 13. Then onwards to Osaka, after checking in we headed to Dotonbori. * **Sun 17:** train towards Nara, stopping first at Horyuji and then Yakushiji and Toshodaiji. Check in at Nara just before seeing the sunset in the park in front of the museum. After dark we walked to the gate at Todaiji, seeing the kongorikishi lit up at night alone was great! * **Mon 18:** Todaiji, Kasugataisha, Kofukuji for the museum (fantastic statues!) because obviously the pagoda is under renovation, then the free machiya at Naramachi Nigiwai-no-le. Around 8 pm we took the train to Kyoto, checked in, then went to see the last day of illumination at Kodaiji. * **Tue 19:** early start at Kinkakuji, then Ryoanji. Then Arashiyami, bamboo grove and Senryuji. Then ukai cormorant fishing, awesome! Dinner at an izakaya in pontocho. * **Wed 20:** first Toji since it was near our hotel, then Nijojo. Nishiki market afterwards. In the afternoon Kiyomizudera for the sunset, walk through Higashiyama and Gion, then kawayuka dinner. * **Thu 21:** Toji once again since we learned of the huge flea market held on the 21st of each month. Then Nishi and Higashi Honganji. The huge gate at Higashi was open so we climbed it. Afterwards we took a train to Uji for Byodoin, then crossed the river for Ujikami shrine, and took the Keihan train to Fushimi for sake tasting. After that we got to Fushimi Inari a bit after sunset, and climbed to the top at night with way less crowds. Yakitori for dinner. * **Fri 22:** last day in Kyoto, we were missing some of the main attractions (imperial palace gardens, Ginkakuji, Heian...) but we decided to escape the crowds and the heat and went north for the Kurama-Kibune hike. We even managed to get a spot at the nagashi somen kawadoko place! In the afternoon back to Higashiyama for Sanjusanjendo and the national museum, which closes at 20 on fridays. For our last meal in Kyoto we found a minuscule obanzai restaurant (literally just someone's kitchen). * **Sat 23:** train back to Osaka to catch the Nankai express for Koyasan. Okunoin in the morning, fire ceremony, check in at Kongo Sanmain, and then in the afternoon we just had time for the museum before everything closed. Back to the shukubo for dinner (delicious shojin ryori!) then a night stroll at Okunoin again. We didn't do the guided tour, too expensive and with so many people it would have lost all the atmosphere. * **Sun 24:** morning ceremony, breakfast, then Kongobuji, Tokugawa Mausoleum and the other sights. Took the train back to Osaka in the early afternoon since we had an helicopter ride booked to see the Daisenryo Kofun (mindblowing!). Then shinkansen to Tokyo. After check in, we managed to see Sensoji lit up. * **Mon 25:** day trip to Nikko. Rinnoji, Toshogu, Futarasan, Taiyuin and Kanmangafuchi Abyss. Simply amazing. Quick outing at Shibuya to see the scramble when we got back to Tokyo. * **Tue 26:** train to Yamanashi for wine tasting at Katsunuma Winery. Then back to Otsu to take the train for mt Fuji, and the Fujiyoshida fire festival. One of the most amazing experiences in the whole trip. * **Wed 27:** from Fuji directly to Kamakura. Kotokuin, Hasedera, and Tsurugaoka. We could have done more temples but we decided to take it easy and managed to go to the beach for a bit. Back to Tokyo for the night. * **Thu 28:** Sumo exhibition tour at Tachikawa. So much fun, 6 hours went by so fast! In the afternoon Meiji Jingu, a bit of shopping at Shibuya, then managed to see the fireworks at Ota City. * **Fri 29:** last day in Japan, breakfast at Tsukiji market, then the national museum. Flight back home in the late afternoon. All in all... fantastic trip! First time in Japan for both of us. Spent around 3500‚Ç¨-4000‚Ç¨ each including flights and everything. Notes: the heat in august is no joke. Be sure to keep hydrated... pocari sweat FTW! Also, we used waaay more cash than we expected. Everywhere we read online said card was accepted 99% of the time... well not really. Luckily withdrawing in yen at the 7/11 ATM was easy and cheap (commissions-wise). Thanks for reading!"}

Going into it, I was mainly interested in Nagasaki for its history, from its founding as a Christian city by the Jesuits to its status as the primary gateway between the world and a closed-off Japan during the Edo period. That part was great as expected, but what I didn't expect was how gorgeous the city and nearby countryside were. The city is surrounded by mountains covered in lush green forests, which as a Tokyo resident was kind of mind-blowing. Kyushu has seen record flooding this year, and I think there was literally a typhoon passing by Kagoshima during my flight there, but miraculously we had beautiful (but very hot and humid) weather everywhere we went. I stayed at Hotel H2 Nagasaki, which was perfectly fine but nothing special. Breakfast definitely not worth it. Good location close to Hamamachi and Chinatown, where all the restaurants are. Day 1 (Atomic Bomb Stuff) * Arrived at Nagasaki Airport in the morning (on an Exeggutor themed plane!) and took the \\~40 min bus to Nagasaki Station. Fare is 1200 yen and IC cards (Suica, etc.) are accepted. * Friend arrived on a later flight, so while waiting I visited the Twenty-Six Martyrs Museum and Monument, built to commemorate a 1597 public execution of Christians by Hideyoshi. The museum is small with informative exhibits on the history of the incident and the Portuguese/Spanish mission in Japan more broadly. There was lots in English and other languages as I believe the site has been officially recognized by the Catholic Church (Popes Francis and John Paul II visited). * Met up with friend at her hotel and ate lunch at nearby Edo Bishi. Very homey place for Nagasaki Chinese food. We were literally served by two elementary school children who must have been on summer break. The signature dish of Nagasaki is champon, which is just a bunch of vegetables and seafood thrown on top of noodle soup, supposedly invented by a Chinese chef who wanted to provide poor Chinese students studying in Japan with something cheap and nutritious. I opted for its soupless variant (instead smothered in goopy sauce), called *sara udon* (literally \"noodles on a plate\"; it's not actually udon noodles), which was delicious. * Took the cute tram to the Atomic Bomb Museum. There aren't really any words to describe the experience or why you should go. If you're in Nagasaki for the first time, just go. It was smaller than I was expecting, took about 2 hours. After you're done it's a short stroll up to the Peace Park, where there's a memorial at the hypocenter with remnants of the original Urakami Cathedral, and further along the famous statue of the man pointing up with one hand to warn of the dangers of the bomb and sideways with the other to signify peace. * Walked a bit to the rebuilt Urakami Cathedral. Not much to see, but you can peek inside for free. On display is a haunting bust of the Virgin Mary that was exposed to the bomb. It looked so symbolic that at first I thought it was an art piece. * Bought some locally grown grapes at Iwanaga Fruits just across the street before hopping on a bus to Sanno Shrine (you get off at Sakamotomachi), where there is a famous torii gate standing on one leg after the other half was blown away by the blast, as well as two camphor trees which appeared totally dead after exposure to the bomb only to grow again into the giants they are today. The beautiful song Kusunoki by Masaharu Fukuyama (super celebrity born in Nagasaki) is about these two trees and was featured at this year's remembrance ceremony. * Back to the city center for dinner at El Dorado Mexican Restaurant &amp; Bar (lol). It was very good but obviously most tourists aren't going to come to Japan and eat Mexican food. I live in Tokyo, where it's relatively hard to find, so that's why I wanted to go. Day 2 (Shimabara) * Rented a car with Toyota and drove out to the Shimabara Peninsula, stopping at a small bakery Patisserie Boulangerie Pack along the way in Obama (!). Picked up a red-bean bun, nothing special but the grandma was nice. The whole drive was scenic. Stopped to get out at this viewing point overlooking terraced potato fields. * Arrived at Kuchinotsu for dolphin watching with Minamishimabara Dolphin Watching, booked online about a week prior. You have to check in at reception 20 minutes before departure. The group was fairly large so we split into two boats. Besides us and a group of Chinese tourists, it seemed like mostly local families with kids. Most of the \\~80 minutes was spent going farther out into the sea and then back again, but we were lucky enough to see a large pod of dolphins. There must have been at least 20 all swimming together very close to the boat. Unfortunately we didn't get to spend much time with them as we had to get back to port, but it was still an incredible experience. Summer is apparently the best time to spot dolphins, though, so I wonder what the average experience is like at other times of the year. * Lunch at nearby Kiyoka. This felt like a hidden gem and was probably my favorite meal of the trip. Unassuming building but we strolled in without a reservation and were shown to a private tatami room. Felt very traditional, the waitresses even do the thing where they kneel before opening the sliding door, and the menu consisted of those set meals where there's like a sampling of twenty different things. I got the \"Ladies' Set\" (around 2000 yen and you don't have to be a lady lol) which had nigiri (tuna, shrimp, egg), sashimi (octopus, salmon, hamo, etc.), dengaku (my favorite), and more. * Visit to the Arima Christian Heritage Museum, a modest local place exhibiting the history of Christianity in Japan in connection with the local warlord Arima Harunobu, one of the daimyo converts, and Hara Castle, the site of a bloody 1637 rebellion where many of the rebels were Christians. I don't remember there being any English. They were selling products from local businesses, and we got some neat biscuits supposedly made according to a traditional recipe from Santa Maria Island in the Azores that the Portuguese missionaries brought over. * Drove over to the Hara Castle Ruins but it seemed like there wasn't much to see and it was sweltering, so decided to just head back to Nagasaki. Stopped in Obama again, this time for delicious sorbet at R cinq famille. * Casual dinner at Asa made Udon. Nothing special but we got to try Got–æÃÑ udon (hailing from the nearby Got–æÃÑ Islands), which is much thinner than your typical Sanuki udon. Day 3 (Random City Stuff) * Ate breakfast at Cafe Hirai, an atmospheric little cafe serving hot sandwiches. I think I had the egg sandwich with a banana soy milk drink, both of which were good. One of the few non-fast food joints open early. * Spent a couple hours in Dejima, the artificial island where all the Dutch traders were sequestered during the Edo period. It's now a sort of historical park with recreated buildings and plenty of informative exhibits. We did an hour-long guided tour (free). The guide was clearly pretty new and wasn't the best public speaker, but he was doing his best so I didn't mind. As a history nerd I could've easily spent more time there, but my friend had a work thing so before splitting up we grabbed Chinese for lunch at Red Lantern inside the Dejima Wharf building. They of course had champon but I opted for congee, which was not bad. * On my own, I headed to –ûÃÑura Cathedral, one of the first churches built as Japan was opening up to the West and the oldest one still standing. There's not much to do inside the actual building but admire the architecture and listen to the spiel playing on the speakers (in Japanese). Most of your time will be spent in the adjacent museum introducing the history of Christianity in Japan. Of the three Christianity-related museums I visited, this one had the most noticeable Christian bent, whereas the other two had more of a neutral historical perspective. * Walked around the nearby Glover Garden, where you can tour the historic homes of prominent foreigners from the late 1800s. To be honest I thought this along with the –ûÃÑura Cathedral were skippable unless you have a particular interest in either, though admittedly I didn't go through the garden too thoroughly as it was very hot. * Cooled off in my hotel before heading toward Mt. Inasa for the night view, eating dinner along the way at Bibi Sushi, a revolving sushi place attached to a soccer stadium. Just walked in and it was pretty empty, but I assume that's because everyone was busy watching the game. Their specialties are local fish and fresh tuna that's never been frozen. You can never go wrong ordering the daily recommendations, which included fish I'd never seen before in Tokyo like *isaki*. They traditionally prefer white fish in Nagasaki, apparently. Everything was delicious, better than most revolving sushi places I've tried in Tokyo. I was alone and ate around 4000 yen worth, so the price is a step up from your Kura Sushi or Sushiro but so is the quality. * Walked over to the cable car station and rode it to the Mt. Inasa Overlook. Honestly if I went again I'd just take a bus up to the top. It wasn't crowded when I went (around 7 p.m.) but I still had to wait a bit, only to be crammed into a small cable car with no air conditioning. Yes, the view is nice, but you're going to see the view at the top regardless. On my way down the line was enormous, which would definitely not be worth it. The view from the mountain is nice, though. Unfortunately there were bright lights on top of the viewing deck so you can't see many stars. Day 4 (Sasebo) * Took an early bus to the airport and from there rented a car with Nippon Rent-A-Car. I reserved online, so just had to go up to the rental car counter in the arrivals area and let them know I was there, then they sent someone to pick us up, as the actual rental shop is across the bridge. * Drove up to Kujukushima (literally \"99 islands\") near Sasebo, which is part of the Saikai National Park. There we got on a cruise to tour the scenic coastline. There were many options, the most basic of which was a large ship like the \"pirate\" ship at Hakone, but we chose the smaller boat which fits around 15 people. Didn't make a reservation as you have to do that by the previous afternoon but there was space, probably because it was a weekday. The guide explains things you see along the way, and the boat can enter small inlets that the large one can't, where we saw tiny jellyfish swimming around. According to our guide, sometimes there's even boar and deer swimming from island to island. * Friend had an earlier flight so I dropped her off at the Saihi bus terminal next to Sasebo Station, from which a bus bound directly for the airport departs, then tried a Sasebo burger, the local specialty owing to American influence from the naval base there, at C&amp;B Burgers. I'm not a huge burger person but it was worth a try. * Headed back to Kujukushima and visited the aquarium, which you get a small discount for if you show them your cruise ticket. Though small, it stood out to me precisely because it focuses on showcasing aquatic life from the surrounding area rather than just gathering popular and impressive species. There were also lots of cute handwritten notes by the staff. The big draws are the dolphin show (which they weren't running as the dolphins needed rest), sea turtles, and many species of local jellyfish. * I had a lot of time to spare (flight wasn't until 9), so I took in some breathtaking views of the island-dotted coastline and the city with naval vessels going in and out of the harbor from Tenkaiho and Yumiharidake, just two of many observation decks in the area. The former was better for looking out over the islands, while the latter offered a better view of the city. * Had my first pide (not a lot of Turkish food where I grew up) at King's Kitchen before driving back to the airport. Owner was a funny guy. Everyone there was speaking English. Overall, I loved Nagasaki and it's definitely one of my favorite destinations in Japan now. The two primary reasons I travel are to see history and nature, and it is top quality in both regards. In the future I hope to check out Hirado, the hot springs at Unzen, and maybe if I'm feeling adventurous, the Got–æÃÑ Islands or Tsushima."}

at the end of the post, i‚Äôll include a day-to-day itinerary of our adventures. we did minimal planning, just general cultural research in preparation. we stayed at the hotel metropolitan edmont in iidabashi in tokyo. this hotel was downright lovely. it was affordable, but so nice. iidabashi is a super quiet neighborhood, so if you‚Äôre looking to be in the middle of the action, i don‚Äôt recommend, but it suited us well. lots of eateries and train stations close by. we were more central in osaka, at the luxcare hotel in tenmabashi. definitely a different vibe from our tokyo hotel, but still good. the location was super convenient overall. we took the metro absolutely everywhere. for context, i lived in nyc and have used the metro in various american and european cities, so i felt very confident navigating. the tokyo metro was a breeze imo. super intuitive and easy to use. a suica card is a MUST! it will get you everywhere you need to go - don‚Äôt even consider paying for another pass, IC covers it all. the osaka metro was a bit more confusing for us. i think it came down to signage and odd station layouts, but we always figured it out in the end. it was obviously super hot, as our visit was mid-late august. i do not recommend visiting this time of year, i‚Äôll be honest. we made do - we‚Äôre from north carolina so the weather just felt like home, but we spent many afternoon hours in our hotel room and found ourselves ducking into stores to find a respite from the heat. an umbrella, fan, and lots of water are non-negotiables. if you do visit in the summer, rely on museums and other indoor activities to save yourself from the relentless sun, take afternoon siestas, and go out at night. we did do a day trip in kyoto, and if i were to change one thing, it would be the amount of nights we stayed in osaka. don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was a super interesting and much more diverse city (from what i saw) than tokyo, but 7 nights weren‚Äôt necessary. i maybe would have opted for 5 and done a couple nights in kyoto. as you‚Äôll see in the itinerary below, we did all the main tourist spots. this was our first visit and they felt obligatory. the next time we visit, we‚Äôll hit smaller, more niche spots. to our credit, we ate at lots of holes in the wall. don‚Äôt shy away from eating at local spots!!! ofc keep an eye out for those rare hostile ‚Äútourists unwelcome‚Äù signs, but in my experience, people are friendly and most restaurants have qr code or tablet ordering. there was definitely awkwardness and minor faux pas along the way, especially in restaurant settings - i feel like that‚Äôs to be expected. we occasionally leaned on google translate but overall we were able to communicate without issue, regardless of language barriers. an example of faux pas on our parts: we often like to grab a snack between meals and share something, especially when it‚Äôs a new food item we‚Äôve never tried before. we didn‚Äôt realize until the end of our trip that it‚Äôs considered rude to order one plate for two people. we were corrected by staff and urged to order a second item, and did so without issue. we just didn‚Äôt realize this was a thing! a final note on osaka: sooo many more gaijin/tourists than tokyo. i was not expecting this! europeans were around every corner. i also found myself getting lots of more stares in osaka. i didn‚Äôt once notice anyone staring at me in tokyo, but almost from the get-go, i clocked it in osaka. i don‚Äôt care to read into why they were staring or what the social context is, i just observed this as a difference between the two cities. general tips: get international phone service for the month of your visit or an esim - it‚Äôs a lifesaver. don‚Äôt get too attached to your plans and account for a rest day / a nap here and there. a suica/ic card is 100% necessary. always carry cash - you may end up using your credit card a lot, but carry it anyway. learn the basic phrases (arigat≈çgozaimasu, sumimasen, gomen nasai) - they will take you far. look up restaurant etiquette. be mindful of social norms and be quiet in public (there are exceptions like izakayas, but i‚Äôm talking about public transit and the average restaurant). day 1 - 7-11 and jet lag. we landed around 9 the night before, got our hotel, and tried to sleep, but made the mistake of sleeping on the plane. if you land in the evening, try to stick it out and stay away. i was a mess this day and got actually sick. a mid-afternoon bath rejuvenated me and we ventured back out in the evening for a gyoza dinner. day 2 - explored the imperial palace grounds and went to akihabara in the evening. visited the 10-story yodobashi camera and super potato. conveyor belt sushi for dinner. day 3 - shibuya - record shopping, many stores, and the hachiko statue. shinjuku - kabukicho and golden gai. we went into an empty bar on a corner with no cover charge and ¬•700 drinks. the man running the place played us guitar and gave me a cigarette. indian for lunch. yakitori for dinner. day 4 - senso-ji temple and karaoke. dinner at an izakaya. day 5 - last day in tokyo. back to shinjuku. art museum, views from the government building, and a rest in chuo park. korea town and a lovely bonchon dinner. thrifting in harajuku. day 6 - fly to osaka (we probably could have taken a bus or train, but oh well, this worked for us). pizza and a shoeless smoke-friendly izakaya. day 7 - universal studios. day 8 - osaka castle (but i lowkey overheated so we didn‚Äôt stick around long). dontonbori. takoyaki and okonamiyaki for dinner. drinks and cigs by the water. day 9 - kyoto. temples, views, markets. sushi and green tea ice cream for lunch. burger king for dinner LOL. day 10 - history museum. beef bowls, unagi, and natto for lunch. shinsekai - rainy and so hot / humid i almost crashed out. sichuan noodles and a shared kebab for dinner. day 11 - private hot spring at an onsen (this ran us ¬•7,200. pricier than a normal onsen, but i have tattoos and we didn‚Äôt want to be separated for the experience). yakiniku for lunch. izakaya hopping in the evening. day 12 - last day. taiwanese breakfast. kaiyukan, ferris wheel, more okonomiyaki. early night and home the next day! if you want any specifics or recommendations, feel free to ask in the comments! the post was long enough so i limited myself lol. thanks for reading :-)"}

Since we have been to Japan before, we decided to focus on off-the-beaten-path destinations in the central Honshu / Japanese Alps between Tokyo and Kyoto. Each of these central Honshu destinations are historic towns with authentic experiences around culture, scenery, food and nature that were unique contrasts to those we‚Äôve experienced previously in the Golden Route cities. Our itinerary was as follows: 1. Fly into KIX (Osaka) 2. **Kyoto**, with day trips to **Nara**, **Asuka** and **Uji** (7 nights total) 3. **Nakatsugawa** as a base for Kiso Valley highlights: **Nakansendo Trail** and **Atera Valley** (3 nights) 4. **Matsumoto** (3 nights) 5. **Hirayu Onsen**, with **Kamikochi** day (1 night) 6. **Takayama** (3 nights) 7. **Shirakawa-go** (day trip going from Takayama to Kanazawa) 8. **Kanazawa** (3 nights) 9. **Nagano** (2 nights) 10. **Tokyo** (2 nights) , Fly out of NRT ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†***Kyoto***: I have been twice before while it was first time for my family. We focused on key highlights by area: * East side: Philosopher's Path to Kiyomizu-dera * Northwest: Kinkakuji and Ryoanji * Northeast: Kurama-dera hike to Kifune Shrine * West: Arashiyama full day, with a stop at Koryuji, the oldest temple in Kyoto which displays National Treasure No. 1 Bodhisattva statue Also had a great time exploring different neighborhoods, local restaurants and Kamo river by bike, which is one of the best ways to explore the city. Kyoto‚Äôs famed Gion Festival was also in full swing towards last few weeks of July, so we saw giant traditional floats and locals in mini-parades going through main streets. ***Overnight / Day Trips from Kyoto:*** **Nara** (overnight trip): We were impressed with Horyuji, the oldest extant wooden building complex in the world and a UNESCO world heritage site. We also explored the Nara Deer Park area. **Asuka:** was an amazing day exploring rural landscapes (‚ÄúMy Neighbor Totoro‚Äù style) which I wrote about in a separate post (please check my profile). **Uji**: Enjoyed matcha tasting, bought some high quality Uji matcha, and explored Byodo-in, one of Japan‚Äôs most scenic temples that is on the 10 yen coin (and you can also see the replica temple in Oahu, Hawaii). We also caught a riverside demonstration of nighttime cormorant fishing using live fire. ***Kiso Valley Highlights:*** From Kyoto, we traveled to ***Nakatsugawa***, a compact town that is a great base for day trips to two ***Kiso Valley*** highlights below: ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†***Nakasendo Trail*** *between* ***Magome and Tsumago (day trip)***: I did a separate post about this iconic section of the Edo-era route (check my profile). This route connects two of the most beautiful Edo-period post towns **Magome-juku** and **Tsumago-juku** and was used by feudal lords and their entourage, merchants, pilgrims and travelers during 1600s-1870s. From Nakatsugawa, we took a 25 min. bus ride to Magome-juku, which we explored and where we ate local soba for lunch. We then had an amazing three hour hike, passing through majestic cedar forests, waterfalls and beautiful rice paddies. We explored Tsumago briefly, then took a short bus ride to Nagiso Station, then returned by train to our hotel in Nakatsugawa. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†***Atera Valley (day trip)***: We had an awesome day exploring what the Japanese call ‚ÄúAtera Blue‚Äù -- stunning turquoise blue, emerald green swimming holes along a crystal clear river. We spent the full day exploring this river, stopping at various spots to swim, dive, and just soak in the spectacular scenery in cool, lush surroundings. You can see some of my pictures from this day in a separate post (check my profile). From Nakatsugawa, we took the train north to Matsumoto where we stayed 3 nights: ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†***Matsumoto***: This is a charming, compact town famous for a beautifully preserved castle with original interior (unique as many castles have refurbished modern interiors). We really loved this \"human scale\" town with its super chill, local vibe and great museums including art from Matsumoto-born Yayoi Kusama. From Matsumoto, we took the reserved bus further into the Japanese Alps for Hirayu Onsen and Kamikochi: ‚Ä¢ ***‚Å†Hirayu Onsen***: Located halfway between Matsumoto and Takayama, Hirayu Onsen is one of many onsen villages that comprise the **Okuhida Onsen** area, known for open air hot springs with mountain/river views. We stayed at a nice historic ryokan that had several open air hot springs baths, a multi-course kaiseki dinner featuring local Hida wagyu cooked over irori fire pits, and an amazing breakfast. This is a good spot to overnight before/after Kamikochi visit. ‚Ä¢ ***‚Å†Kamikochi (day trip)***: After checking out of our ryokan, we went to the Hirayu Onsen bus depot, where you can catch the buses to Kamikochi, considered one of Japan‚Äôs most beautiful nature spots. This is a stunning alpine valley in the Japanese Alps, and it was a perfect easy hike / walking day in a spectacular nature setting. You can also visit Kamikochi as a day trip from either Matsumoto or Takayama, (or on your way between these towns). At the end of the Kamikochi day, we took the bus to Takayama, where we stayed 3 nights: ‚Ä¢ ***‚Å†Takayama***: This is a picturesque Edo-era mountain town. When we arrived, there was a weekend night market, live music performances on the street, and fireworks, so it was quite nice to join the locals who were out and about enjoying themselves. We loved biking around the traditional wooden merchant houses, checking out morning markets, and visiting Hida folk village. The main river that runs through the town is filled with carp, a beautiful scene. We also ate Hida wagyu, the local beef that this region (Hida) is famous for. ‚Ä¢ **Hida Furukawa (half day trip)**: A pleasant half day to a small town north of Takayama which is known for carp-filled canals, sake breweries, and as the inspiration for the fictional town in the hit anime movie *Your Name* (Âêõ„ÅÆÂêç„ÅØ, Kimi no Na wa). From Takayama, we headed to Kanazawa via a day trip to Shirakawa-go: ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†***Shirakawa-go (day trip)***: This is a super scenic Hida mountain village (UNESCO world heritage) famed for iconic gassho-zukuri farmhouses found in the Hida region. This village is beautiful in all seasons, particularly in winter when it is decked out in snow. This village can be done as a day trip from either (or between) Kanazawa and Takayama, 1-1.5 hr bus ride each way. After your day trip to Shirakawa-go, you can continue by bus to Kanazawa: ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†***Kanazawa*** is a special town that rivaled Kyoto and Edo (Tokyo) as a cultural hub during Edo period as the base of the Maeda clan, the second most powerful after the ruling Tokugawa clan. We visited the stunning Kenrokuen, one of Japan‚Äôs ‚Äúthree most beautiful gardens‚Äù; explored the castle complex, samurai villas and geisha chaya district, and also checked out some great modern museums (21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art and DT Suzuki museum). You can also shop for traditional crafts among numerous shops in Kanazawa. We also had amazing seafood and Omicho market in a good spot to try them. From Kanazawa, we took the Shinkansen clockwise to Nagano, taking a bit over an hour. ‚Ä¢ ***‚Å†Nagano***: We visited the historic Zenkoji temple, around which the city of Nagao grew. There is a great shopping / dining street that leads up to the temple. We bought a variety of shichimi spices from the famous Yawataya Isogoro shop, which has been selling their shichimi here since 1736. We also had a great day trip to Togakushi Shrine, a mountain area with truly majestic cedar-lined pilgrimage road that links 3 key shrines associated with earliest Japanese mythologies. We had a great lunch at a local soba restaurant and spend our day leisurely hiking in the cool forest paths. There is a Ninja museum as well, although we did not have time to visit this. From Nagano, we headed to Tokyo by 1.5 hr Shinkansen. ‚Ä¢ ***‚Å†Tokyo***: We have visited Tokyo many times, so we only spent 2 nights before our flight out. We enjoyed sushi omakase, explored the neighborhoods around Nippori Station, teamlabs Borderless and Tokyo National Museum. We had an amazing Anago lunch set at a restaurant called Anago Tamai (Nihonbashi main branch) before our train to Narita airport. **\\*\\*\\*Japan Tips &amp; Recommendations\\*\\*\\*** I will skip the usual stuff about adding Suica to your phone, etc. and add some nuance: **Tip #1:** It‚Äôs essential to **‚Äúgo with the flow‚Äù of existing train/bus routes** when planning itineraries. Avoid trying to do crazy connections that will require multiple transfers and eat up most of your valuable travel day, e.g. \"I want to go from Takayama to Nakasendo Trail\". These spots look relatively close on a map, but they are actually separated by towering Japanese Alps mountains which means you‚Äôd need to do a big V route along train lines that only radiate out from Nagoya. Similarly, Matsumoto could be 3-6 hours from Tokyo by car or train/bus combo, but only 2 hrs and 20 min if you go via Nagano (due to Shinkansen from Tokyo). So it would only be natural to consider adding Nagano in your itinerary even if you were just interested in Matsumoto for Kamikochi at first. **Tip #1a**: Use japan-guide.com and check \"Get There\" section -- this lists all the usual logistics options to access and get around any given location. **Tip #1b**: **Choose local, slower trains vs reserved faster trains, whenever sensible**: Often the time difference is not meaningful, local trains could be 30-60% cheaper, and you don't need to stress about making specific trains /seats or waste time with station machines / people. Google Maps shows the different options and prices. **Tip #1c**: **Bus:** Check online for published bus schedules between Matsumoto - Kamikochi/Hirayu Onsen - Takayama - Shirakawa-go - Kanazawa routes. **Alpico** (originating from Matsumoto) and **Nohi** (originating from Takayama). There are frequent buses that connect these spots, but some legs require reservations beforehand. Fortunately, you can reserve these easily online (starting a month beforehand) and use mobile QR tickets to get on/off these reserved buses. Many legs don't require reservations and are typically bought same day -- for example, Kamikochi / Hirayu Onsen to Takayama is bought same day. If there are too many people, the Nohi bus company just sends another bus to accommodate everyone. **Tip #2**: **Bring cash and coins to these parts.** You can use Suica and credit cards in the big cities, but cash is essential in areas like Kiso Valley and Kamikochi -- many stations here (even JR lines) do NOT take Suica or credit cards. Often these small stations don't even have turnstiles - you just get on trains freely and someone pops out at your destination to collect cash/coins from you. Many restaurants only take cash. In Hirayu / Kamikochi, there are no ATMs available. **Tip #3:** **Pack light!** One carry-on and a backpack per person makes life so much easier. Try to arrange hotels or Airbnbs with washer/dryers at least every 4-5 days (and most hotels have coin operated washer/dryers). **Tip #3a**: **Bring a simple collapsible bag** to use at the end for shopping. We still brought back boxes of sneakers, clothes, food souvenirs, personal care goods, kitchen tools, etc., mostly purchased towards the end of our itinerary. **Tip #4**: **Restaurant Reservations**: We had some amazing meals throughout our trip, but did not stress out about reservations at all. The only reservations we made were for two sushi omakase meals in Kyoto (Sushi Iwata a few days beforehand via Instagram) and Tokyo (Manten Sushi on their website via Tablecheck). The rest were just walk-ins, or rarely last minute reservations when we got to the city. For example, we had two of our best dinners of our trip in Nakatsugawa, including Waraidokoro Airo (Á¨ëÂá¶ „ÅÇ„ÅÑ„Çç), an obanzai place run by two smiling ladies, and Shabu Shabu Aoyagi (Âøó„ÇÉ„Å∂„Åó„ÇÉ„Å∂ ÈùíÊü≥), a counter-only place run by an elderly couple. Both are limited capacity restaurants, so we simply made a reservation once we got to Nakatsugawa. For Airo I just walked over before dinner service started to ask for a table an hour later; for Aoyagi, they initially turned us away, so I made a reservation for the following night."}

Stop scrolling and use this itinerary for your own walking tour. **Shinjuku City, Tokyo**: Beautiful city. Highlights include an early morning walk through Meiji Jingu and Yoyogi Park, in one of the most pedestrian-friendly big cities. However, this trip was focused mostly on nature walks so our stay in Tokyo was short. **Hakone**: We took the Romance Car from Tokyo to Hakone and spent an amazing two nights at a historic Ryokan. Highlights include the very quiet evenings, Gora Park, the Open Air Museum, and a very early morning walk in Onshi-Hakone Park to view Mt Fuji, before taking the touristy Pirate Ship, and Ropeway (which were fabulous). For being super touristy, this place was gorgeous. We used the gender-separated public onsen, which was amazing. **Nakasendo Trail**: We spent 4 days walking between post towns Nakasugawa, Magome, Tsumago, Nagiso, Kiso-Fukushima, and Narai. The forest walks and waterfalls were spectacular, but the best views were near the small villages surrounded by rice fields and the beautiful Japanese countryside. Typical morning walks were only 4-5 hours, with slow lunches, and a soak in the onsen after a quiet dinner. We packed very light for this trip and had no trouble with our 12lb day packs. The trails were very quiet, and food and drink options were plentiful with a bit of planning. **Kanazawa**: One of the prettiest gardens in all of Japan is Kenrokuen and we walked every part of that garden. This was a large city, and so our stay was short. **Kyoto**: We spent 4 days in Kyoto, and for being a large city it was incredible. A top highlight was a quiet bike ride right along the Kamo River to the botanical garden‚Ä¶, one of our favorite bike rides anywhere, and eating lunch at the very busy Nishiki Market. We walked through a dozen amazing gardens, parks, and shrines, and enjoyed delicious food at many small restaurants. **Kumono Kodo**: We spent 5 days on a 75 km pilgrimage walk on a gorgeous forest path, walking between very old moss-covered shrines and quiet mountain streams. Reservations are organized by the Tanabe City Kumono Tourism Bureau, and you must plan many months in advance in order to choose the best locations right near the trail. If you want to be surrounded by some of the best scenery in rural Japan, start planning your trip now. All of the Japanese people (and most of the other visitors) we met along the way were friendly, happy, and kind. We took a few wrong turns, hiked in a downpour, and once had trouble finding an ATM, but enjoyed every minute of it! Thanks Reddit."}

I‚Äôm a bit of a travel planning junkie so I wrote a 10,000 plus word trip record and kept a record of all spending transactions for this entire trip because I‚Äôm crazy - so I have a lot of details around the trip recorded. We travelled with a group of 70s, 50s and 20s. We stayed in AirBnb in Tokyo and Osaka mainly because we find that our AirBnb fitted our needs better than hotels as a large group of various age groups. We travel on a good value budget basis. I am happy to answer any follow up questions. Here‚Äôs our itinerary Day 1 Arrival - Arrived Sat night into Narita, used an airport transfer, and checked into our AirBnb Day 2 Asakusa ‚Äì Dressed up for some folks, hung around Asakusa, attended the Tanabata (star festival) street festival on Kappanboshi street. Rested in the afternoon. Attended the Samurai Ninja Museum and shopped around Asakusa in the late evening. Day 3 Harajuku &amp; Shibuya - mainly shopping and visited the Cat alley Day 4 Pokemon Caf√© and Ginza - best way to get reservations to Pokemon Caf√© turned out to be to check the night before at between 8.00 pm to 10.00 pm which we successfully did. This was only Japanese activity I failed to get a way advanced reservation despite actively trying before we arrive in Japan. Shopped in Ginza for clothing at Uniqlo flagship etc. Day 5 Ghibli Museum ‚Äì travelled to Shirohige's Cream Puff Factory to get Ghibli theme food to set the mood and then to Ghibli Museum for noon entry. Izakaya dinner for everyone. Day 6 Akihabara and Ikebukuro‚Äì rest day for some, rest did cosplay and anime shopping at Akihabara and Ikebukuro. Day 7 Enoshima &amp; Kamakura ‚Äì booked a day trip to Enoshima and Kamakura. At Enoshima, we visited the Imaya caves, then took the tram to Komachi Street. Visited the Tsurugaoka Hachmangu shrine and the Giant Buddha at Kamakura too. Day 8 TeamLabs ‚Äì visited the Team Labs Borderless in the morning and spent some time at Aazbudai Hills food market and finished some late shopping in Akihabara. Day 9 Travel to Osaka ‚Äì took the Shinkansen to Osaka and then checked into our AirBnb. Visited the Kuromon market and then had dinner at Shinsekai Day 10 Osaka ‚Äì visited the Lion Head Namba Jika shrine, walked through the Namba area to get some food including the Rikuro cheesecake. Visited the Hezon-ji Temple before having a street food lunch at the Dontobori area, including taking photos of the Glico Man in a dedicated area. Then headed north to Americura for some second hand clothing shopping (a standout activity in Japan). Had the famous ice cream hot dog which was very above expectation. Ended at Pokemon Osaka in Shinsaibashi and then back to the AirbnB Day 11 Kyoto &amp; Arashiyama ‚Äì took an early local train to Arashiyama Bamboo Forest. Then climbed the Arashiyama Monkey Park before having lunch at the Arashiyama Rilakkuma Caf√©. Took cabs to Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion). Then took cabs to our hotel in Kyoto for our 2 night stay. Attended the evening performance at Gion Corner. Day 12 Kyoto ‚Äì after breakfast headed to Kiyomizu-dera. Then walked to Kodai-ji temple. Next walked past the Maruyama Park before ending up at Yasaka temple. We then had lunch, visited the Nisihiki market, had a brief stop at Pokemon Kyoto and finally visited the Museum of Kyoto. For dinner we visited the food street market for Gion Matsuri (the Kyoto Summer festival). Day 13 Kyoto ‚Äì attended the Gion Matsuri parade though it rained heavily all day which dampened down the festivities. After lunch we took the local train back to our Airbnb in Osaka. Day 14 Osaka Expo Day ‚Äì We planned and scenario built Osaka Expo extensively via Excel of course, it‚Äôs not an activity I would recommend to just rock up without planning. We left early to get to our 9.00 am entry, but only managed to get in around 9.40 am. For myself I ended up doing this in sequence (with no real successful reservations that day). Japan Pavilion ‚Äì&gt; German Pavilion -&gt; South Korean Pavilion -&gt; Singapore Pavilion -&gt; Hungary Pavilion -&gt; Oman Pavilion -&gt; Qatar Pavilion -&gt; UAE Pavilion -&gt; Day Time Water Show -&gt; Future City Pavilion -&gt; Spain Pavilion -&gt; Earth At Night Pavilion -&gt; Malaysia Pavilion -&gt; Night Water Show -&gt; Drone Show -&gt; Swiss Pavilion. Some of our group did less, one of our group did 5+ more. Main ones I did different from the others were the Australia Pavilion and the China Pavilion, while I tried 3-4 times unsuccessfully to get same day reservations at kiosk. Day 15 Nara ‚Äì Slower pace day to recover from Osaka Expo Day. Took the train to Nara and visited the Kofuuji Temple and the surrounding complex. Then spend a bit of time at Nara Deer Park feeding the deer. Took a short break at the free Yoshikien Garden before heading to the lantern centric Kasuga Taisha Shrine. We skipped the Todai-ji shrine. Then headed back to the Airbnb. Day 16 Miyajima &amp; Hiroshima ‚Äì took the shinkansen to Hiroshima and then the local ferry across to Miyajima island. Walked to the Itsukushima Torii gates (it was low tide), then visited the Daisho-in temple. Got some exclusive Rilakkuma merchandise at the Omotesand≈ç Shopping Street. Then had a Anago lunch with fried oysters. Both Anago (Sea eel) and Oysters are good food to try out at the island. Then took a direct ferry back to Hiroshima and visited the Hiroshima Peace Museum, the Memorial Park and the Dome. Then visited the Pokemon Hiroshima Center at the Hiroshima station before heading back to the Airbnb Day 17 Ghibli Park Day ‚Äì took an early Shinkansen to Nagoya and then two local trains Ghibli Park. One of us is a huge studio Ghibli park fan so this was a must do in Japan .We had the premium tickets so did all the park related activity, lots of photos were taken that day ‚Äì more details can be shared. And then took the long 3 hour journey home when the park is nearly closed. Others who didn‚Äôt join us visited the Osaka Castle instead. Day 18 Himeji &amp; Kobe ‚Äì we took a Shinkansen to Himeiji Castle and spent a couple of hours there before taking another Shinkansen to Kobe for lunch at the Kobe Steakland. Then we walked around Kobe Chinatown a bit before heading back to Osaka for dinner at the Namba area. Day 19 Universal Studios Japan ‚Äì some of us were keen to visit Super Nintendo World, so we left early. Official opening hour that day was 8.30 am but it opened at 8.00 (that's normal and expected) and we ended up at Super Nintendo World by 8.10 am without any Fast pass or the like. The most ambitious of our group managed to get onto the following rides all before 2.00 pm, in roughly this order. Mario Kart -&gt; The Flying Dinosaur (multiple times that day) -&gt; Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey -&gt; Hollywood Dreams -&gt; Jurassic Park -&gt; Jaws -&gt; Minion Mayhem -&gt; Spy X Family XR Ride -&gt; Flight of the Hippogriff. Basically every thrill ride except for the new Donkey Kong Ride (which had a 3 hour wait time by 8.30 am!). We also did all the decent shows like Waterworld, Dorameon 4D, Sing and the Monster Rock mostly a good choice to hide from the heat. We finished and left the park around 6.00 pm. Day 20 Osaka -&gt; last full day for us in Osaka, so after we arranged for some luggage to ship to our Tokyo hotel, I ended up at the Shitennoji Temple to get a taste of the Tenjin Matsuri. Also walked the tenshindori-suji arcade shop which had at least a dozen temple carrying parades go through there in preparation of the following day‚Äôs proper Matsuri Tenjin which we will miss. Then back to Airbnb for our journey back to Tokyo. Had a sukiyaki dinner. Day 21 Tokyo -&gt; arrive via Shinkanesen in the morning to check into our Tokyo hotel next to the Tokyo Station. Did some last minute shopping around the area and a sushi dinner. Day 22 Last day in Japan -&gt; Headed to Ueno to visit the Tokyo National Museum, then off to Narita airport and getting last minute exclusive Pokemons from Narita Airport for our evening flight out of Japan. This ended our 3 week holiday in Japan. Most days we started early but finished not too late in light of the age and fitness of our group. I built in some flexibility in our schedule (despite what it seems from the itinerary above) and we were not too stressed if we missed out certain activities. We treated the heat in July with respect but it wasn‚Äôt an impossible challenge. If you have any questions or thoughts, I am happy to help and respond to them. Hope you have a great trip in Japan yourselves."}

I‚Äôd love to share our itinerary and travel experiences with you. It‚Äôs a fairly factual overview, mainly intended to give a general idea of what there is to do and what is feasible in a day. I don‚Äôt review everything in detail, but we honestly enjoyed almost everything‚Äîunless I specifically mention otherwise. Feel free to ask about any specific experiences or practical tips, tho! **Day 1 (Sunday, May 18)** * Arrival in Tokyo. Arrival around 2 PM at Narita airport. * By train and Yamanote line to our apartment in Shinjuku. * To Senso-ji and the Sanja Matsuri festival in Asakusa. We were lucky to be there exactly on the final day of this annual festival in Tokyo. (Every third weekend of May). * Ended the evening in Kabukicho/Golden Gai (walking distance from our apartment). **Day 2 (Monday, May 19)** * Meiji shrine + inner garden * Yoyogi park (We had planned to go there on Saturday or Sunday, as it‚Äôs said to be very lively on weekends. Due to a problem with our flight, we only arrived in Tokyo on Sunday afternoon, so that didn‚Äôt work out. On Monday the park was very quiet). * Harajuku (including Takeshita street) * Shibuya crossing * Akihabara **Day 3 (Tuesday, May 20)** * Kappabashi dori * Ueno park * Ueno Toshogu shrine * Tokyo national museum * Shinobazuno pond benten * Ameyokocho market * Walk through Nezu and Yanaka (nicely quiet after a day in the crowds). * Nezu Shrine * Dinner in Omoide Yokocho **Day 4 (Wednesday, May 21)** * Shinjuku Gyoen * Yokohama (Minato Mirai and China Town) * Football match Yokohama F. Marinos ‚Äì Vissel Kobe **Day 5 (Thursday, May 22)** * Imperial palace / Kokyo gaien * Tsukiji fish market * Grand Sumo tournament in the Ryogoku Kokugikan. One of the highlights of the trip. Totally into sumo ever since. See my earlier comment about the experience. * Tokyo Skytree. One of the few less enjoyable experiences that generally felt a bit like a tourist trap. The view was quite nice, but we were a bit late so it was already getting dark. Also, it was very crowded and we had to wait a long time to get up and especially to get back down. **Day 6 (Friday, May 23)** * Start of a 4-day road trip through the Japanese Alps. * Arakurayama Sengen Park / Chureito Pagoda. We hoped to see Fuji, but unfortunately it was hidden in the mist so not visible. * Drove on to Matsumoto. Visit to Matsumoto Castle. * Stay in a Ryokan hotel with onsen, traditional Kaiseki meal. **Day 7 (Saturday, May 24)** * Hiking in the beautiful Kamikochi (Chubu Sangaku National Park) * Dinner in Takayama * Overnight stay in Shirakawa-go **Day 8 (Sunday, May 25)** * Enjoying the beautiful famous houses in Shirakawa-go and the slightly further located Gokayama. * Continuation of the road trip to Kanazawa, overnight stay in Kanazawa **Day 9 (Monday, May 26)** * Traditional tea ceremony * Kenroku-garden * Kanazawa castle * Final part of road trip from Kanazawa to Kyoto **Day 10 (Tuesday, May 27)** * Arashiyama Bamboo grove. Quite beautiful but small and very crowded. The bamboo forest on Mt. Inari was much more impressive. * Nishiki market * Gion (Sannenzaka, Ninenzaka, Yasaka pagoda, Yasaka shrine). * Fushimi Inari Taisha. We didn‚Äôt just stay on the main path but also took the ‚Äòhidden trail‚Äô and we loved it. Very beautiful bamboo forest. At the top of Mount Inari a great view over Kyoto by night. **Day 11 (Tuesday, May 28)** * Nijo castle * By Shinkansen from Kyoto to Fukuyama and from there a local train to Onomichi. Great to enjoy an ekiben bought at the train station along the way. **Day 12 (Wednesday, May 29)** * Shimanami Kaido! With rented road bikes from Onomichi across islands and bridges through the Seto Inland Sea to Imabari on Shikoku. Very cool for people who enjoy sporty activities like ourselves. **Day 13 (Thursday, May 30)** * Trip from Imabari to Hiroshima * Peace memorial park / Atomic dome / Peace memorial Hall + museum. Impressive.. **Day 14 (Friday, May 31)** * We flew from Hiroshima to Okinawa where we stayed for 3 nights. Unfortunately the weather was disappointing so we didn‚Äôt do much there, but we did relax. **Day 17 (Tuesday, June 3)** * Flight from Okinawa to Osaka. * Baseball match Orix Buffaloes ‚Äì Hiroshima Carps. **Day 18 (Wednesday, June 4)** * Osaka castle * Kuromon market * Shinsekai * Tsutenkaku Tower * Dotonbori street **Day 19 (Thursday, June 5)** * Osaka 2025 world expo. See my earlier review. * ROR comedy club. **Day 20 (Friday, June 6)** * Traditional Bunraku performance at the National Bunraku theatre. * Return flight from Osaka back home. **General experiences/impressions** An amazing trip through a beautiful and diverse country with rich culture, history, stunning nature, buzzing modern cities, calm parks, beautiful gardens, friendly people and delicious food. Love the food markets, love the konbinis, LOVE the izakayas. Our travel pace was high and it was definitely not a ‚Äòrelax vacation‚Äô. But overall it was doable. For fit and active travelers this schedule is feasible, for people who prefer a slower pace it might be (too) intense. Hopefully this helps you in planning your own trip and feel free to ask me anything you‚Äôd like to know!"}

A full budget breakdown will be at the end including a link to the Spreadsheet I used to track my expenses. This was a solo trip I began planning for 8 months. I tend to overplan before cutting stuff out in the moment. This is going to be very in depth, so strap in and grab some popcorn if you want to tuck in! Day -1: Flying nonstop MSP to HND was ~$1500 for regular Economy. I have my classic drink order: Woodford Reserve whiskey to sleep lol **Day 0: High Table**: Landing in Haneda (HND), it took just 30 minutes from getting off the plane to leaving customs with my backpack and checked luggage. I reserved a 3GB Pocket WiFi from NinjaWiFi like always, which was plenty for solo travelling and using Google Maps every other moment. I used Timeshifter to help minimize my jet lag, which did help!! I also had melatonin with me as well to ensure my best chances of being jet lagged for not that long. I reserved a Gran Class ticket (to be used later) with my JR Rail Pass at the JR East Travel Center, and got some free chopsticks, neat! I wandered around Haneda Airport Garden but wasn‚Äôt too impressed. LODGING, which I booked for my whole March 31 - April 12 stay: Pegasus Hostel. 200 USD total via AirBnB. While the hostel was a little cramped, and you have to carry luggage up stairs, the in unit (I forgot if it was coin operated) laundry and free WiFi is nice to have, and I was more than happy given how cheap the accommodation was. The receptionist mainly speaks Mandarin, so my Cantonese did not really work, and we made do with English and Google Translate which had no issues. Let me tell ya, this hostel is a sleeper pick location-wise!! You are &lt;5 min away walking from Asakusabashi Station, ONE stop away from Akihabara, ONE train ride to-from HND if you take Keisei thru line to the Asakusa Line, and a more involved walk to Bakuroch≈ç Station. There is a FamilyMart and 7-Eleven within a 2 minute walk, along with Naruto Taiyaki Honpo Asakusabashi shop for a nice evening Taiyaki. There is a caveat though, taking the Chuo Line from here is almost always super busy, and the station‚Äôs east exit is a little cramped, so I would not recommend it as much if you have more than 1 rolling luggage. I ate supper over in Akihabara at Wako Tonkatsu Akiba 8th Floor, as PremierTwo recommended it, quite nice and super filling! I would need this to prepare my liver for‚Ä¶ HIGHLIGHT: Bar BenFiddich. I had to reserve this in advance, and I felt ultra intimidated being in such a curated and intimate space. I felt small in my expansive seat, as I was seated right in front of Hiroyasu Kayama himself! I got to see him make most of the drinks ordered in that 2 hour slot, and it was magical. I had to wrack my imagination for drink orders since this place has no menu. He put me at ease, and made 3 cocktails that I will never forget. *Scotch? + Passion fruit w/ Muscat Liquor, chocolate?, and fennel sprinkles* My request: something using the muscat grape. He blowtorched the top?! WHAT. But it was a brilliant gradient of flavor. *Japanese Gin w/ Lavender Distilled Water* My request: something floral. It‚Äôs perfectly fragrant, topped with a sprig of lavender. It‚Äôs wavy in the sense of winds going over a lavender field. *Chery Brandy + Drouet Cognac VS Grande Champagne* My request: ‚Äúa warm hug on a cold snowing day.‚Äù He then makes this HOT tiny dainty signature cocktail, which was literally on fire at some point. WHAT. It was right on point with my abstract request, and my only regret was that I could not finish it‚Ä¶ because 3 drinks would put me to sleep. I am a lightweight, 6‚Äô 2‚Äù, 160 lbs, half white (Germany + Wales), half Chinese, and 2 drinks is enough to make me drunk. I needed to make sure I could take the train back to my hostel lmaooo Step Count: roughly 9k steps **Day 1: Eye‚Äôs Up**: It‚Äôs April Fool‚Äôs Day, so I did not sleep great, only sleeping 11-3-5-6? The rain in the morning was not welcome. Maybe it being April Fool‚Äôs was unrelated. I ate breakfast at Kameido Gusto (decent, but would‚Äôve preferred a konbini) before buying a shirt from Work Land. I got new glasses at Jins (Akihabara Yodobashi Camera), but it took 2 days of having a mental breakdown before I started liking the glasses lmaoooo. Lunch was at Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building‚Äôs Cafeteria bc I make it a consistent staple to eat there once per Japan trip. The curry was good, but the cafe pastry left much to be desired. I bought souvenirs at Shinjuku Marui Annex before walking to Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden which was not that busy due to the light rain throughout the whole day. I sauntered into Omotesando but did not buy anything there. I took the train back, and it stopped for several minutes, an odd occurrence‚Ä¶ My night ends with a mashup supper of a 7-Eleven onigiri, a FamilyMart fried chicken, and some dried persimmons before going to SAKE street nearby for a flight of sweet sake. 14.5k steps **Day 2: PremierMe**: After a crisp 9 hours of sleep, I‚Äôm up for breakfast at Ootoya. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! For only 600 JPY, I got red rice, miso soup, chicken, and unlimited drinks. A killer breakfast set for basically $4 USD. Once again, my train stops in the middle of the line‚Ä¶ huh. I spend a fair amount of time taking Shinkansen pictures from the Nippori Station‚Äôs North Bridge before trying to find cats at Yanaka Ginza. The rain eventually stops, but not before I get some gelato and a latte from Guru Guru. The Yanaka Cemetery is a great place to visit. A stroll around leads to some peaceful adages, loads of sakura, and the rare stray cat. Another train down to Ueno leads to plenty of souvenirs, shaved ice, and lunch at Uo Tsuka: full of oysters, ikura-don, and a sweet sake to pair with the seafood. I eventually end up at Ishibashiinari Shrine where I adjust my itinerary until loud bells begin ringing. It‚Äôs 3PM, and a ceremony of sorts seems to be happening. I bask in the loud noises, before I drop off my purchases at my hostel. Following a few of the steps that PermierTwo took in his 2024 Meguro walk and talk, I witness the sakura festival at Naka-Meguro! Stopping at Kura Sushi for supper, I go to the raised crossing that is the inspiration for the location where Akane Kurokawa is saved by Aqua Hoshino in Oshi no Ko Season 1. A bit of a trek from the station, but nothing unusual. I stop at Traveler‚Äôs Factory, a haven for stationary lovers, although I only buy a small notebook refill there. Next is SLOWJAM GARAGE for a sakura highball, where somehow I feel a brief and fleeting sense of community. I get a bit more food, some gyoza at Ohka the Bestdays. Last stop of the day was Bar Panorma Ginza, which fun fact: is not located in Ginza. A pain to find, but once you enter you are in a textbook otaku paradise. No no, not for anime. Trains! The bulk of the floorplan is taken up by the lovely trainset! A shinkansen zips around. A local train whirs past, and there are more model trains on the walls! All of the drinks are train line themed, you HAVE to order the Yamanote Line drink if you like sweet and/or melon. To unwind, I went to Akihabara because I found a Taiko machine cheaper than all the others‚Ä¶ how? I got 3 songs per play instead of 2‚Ä¶ ohohoho it is #MusicMaxxing time! I would do this most nights‚Ä¶ I like combining violence (hitting a drum) with music (anime openings). 20.3k steps **Day 3: A Simple Meal**: I didn't sleep that long, which was okay because I spent 6 hours in Akihabara! I got Pork Belly Curry for lunch at Hinoya Curry before spending 2x retail price on a countryside Miku figurine at a crane game, oof. I popped into Yusha Kobo which is a super cool physical keyboard shop. Yeah, you‚Äôre better off buying it all online, but it‚Äôs nice to see and test the keyboards and switches yourself!~ I waltz on over to Shibuya, and I immediately get lost. Not in the station, but in the basement department store of Shibuya Mark City. I swear, every department store could use better wayfinding, but I‚Äôll live. I eventually found Kageyamarou to have some soba for supper! A perfect fuel for the drinks I am about to indulge in, I get out on the streets, and what‚Äôs that? PLAYERS by YOASOBI is playing! I am so elated, I saunter, skip, and dance my way down the street to LOST Bar. I enjoy the April Cocktail: License to Chill, Like a Magic Mule, and the cracker-cheese plate! I push myself to eat it all, even if I accidentally stalled my appetite‚Ä¶ oops lol my greed tends to get the best of me &gt;~&gt; 10.4k steps **Day 4: A-S-O So Much Volcano**: It is time to be ambitious! I take a 7AM flight down to Kumamoto, with a rental car in wait, ready to drive towards Aso. No, there were no Pikachu plushies in the vending machines, very sad. I was amazed security took only 1 minute AND I could bring water through security??? America could never. I miss spotting Mt Fuji from the plane which is very sad, but I was about to see more mountains! The rental kei car was awesome! Getting &gt;50 mpg, taking only &lt;10 seconds on ignition for it to recognize and automatically play music from my iPad, and the snazzy gps. Oooo, now this is a nice upgrade from my Chevy Spark. While it was only 57F outside, it was warm coming from Minnesota~. Ozu Roadside Station was filled with samples aplenty, so ofc I had to buy some Ube Cheesecake, which was the tastiest thing I sampled there. I try horse meat in a bun at Michi no Eki Aso, and I even get to glimpse the Seven Stars of Kyushu train there! Next up is Milk Factory for some cheese on soft serve, before winding up to Daikambo Lookout Point. Something worth mentioning is that even on these mountainy roads, everyone is going 10-20 kmph over the speed limit. A brief visit to Meoto Falls, preps me for the quaint town of Kurokawa Onsen. Did I go there because it shared a last name with my favorite anime character in *Oshi no Ko*? Yes. Did I also go there because of the nice onsens? Yes. LODGING: Yamamizuki. I splurged 40480 JPY for a night here with their seasonal kaiseki meals. There is so much info, so I am shaking with worry, but this time I do not get an anxiety attack trying to put on my yukata! I take a quick bath before I see my FIVE COURSE KAISEKI and another portion laid out in front of me. Because the room was for 2, there were 2 portions (next breakfast would only have 1 though), so I got extras of the real good stuff~! There was so much food, all so good, this was well worth the steep cost! I go back into the onsen before I fall asleep to the river noises beyond my window. 7.2k steps **Day 5: POP IN 2**: Waking up at 5AM means that I get to take an early bath! There were two tourists speaking Cantonese in the bath so I *had to* reply back in Cantonese (bc my mother is from Guangzhou). The two men were stunned, and I will forever grin at their shocked expressions. Breakfast was plentiful, and I finished the last bit of sake before I *pop in 2* the tourist center in town to buy a couple towels and a pouch to carry them in. Driving down to Takachiho, I park at the Eki store after checking that parking by the gorge is all full. It‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ just about walkable (downhill is okay, it‚Äôs uphill that‚Äôs rough) over to my reservation for‚Ä¶ HIGHLIGHT: Rowboat in Takachiho Gorge! It‚Äôs genuinely quite beautiful, you get to be tens of feet deep as you maneuver yourself along the black rock and falling water. I spy a local shop on my way walking up, where I got some dango with walnut sauce and an orange-mango swirl soft serve! What‚Äôs up with soft serve? I guess America is also a fan of soft serve in fast food and such, but is there any reason why Japan likes soft serve too? Let me know! Next is the freshwater aquarium, a nice quaint place with a sturgeon, an axolotl, and more! I chose this area because it‚Äôs where *Oshi no Ko* begins! I **just missed** the Oshi no Ko Season 2 x Takachiho collab event, but thankfully a couple places still had merch left! Around this time, I have a mental breakdown because I bought the Onsen Pass at Kurokawa Onsen and have yet to use it, so I hastily drive back to Kurokawa to use ‚Öî of the pass at Sanga Ryokan for the baths and a fruit drink. It starts raining on my parade back to Kumamoto, and then I make a minor mistake at KMJ. I accidentally bought frozen basashi instead of fresh, and I threw it out because I did not have facilities at my hostel to work with it. Curse me being rushed and not wanting to say no to the shopkeep. I still slept an hour on the flight though! 8.5k steps **Day 6: TOP LINE, TOP CLASS**: I lost that Gran Class ticket I booked ;-; so I had to buy a new one‚Ä¶ At least Gran Class is SUPER CUSHY. Free slippers, water, Katsuyama Ken Sake, a small meal? It was so nice, I even did some homework on the train to Morioka. But the train of bad news does not stop only there. Turns out I LEFT my Apple Pencil on the train. After anxiously waiting with the staff, I was told to check back with the Sendai staff (as I‚Äôd be there in 2 hours). At least Morioka Station had heat lamps, that was nice. Plus I had a cheap and swift lunch at Soba no Hana. As per the staff in Sendai, it turns out my Apple Pencil went all the way to Hakodate. That‚Äôs not good. Because I booked a hostel, the receptionist wanted me to be there on arrival to pay for the delivery, and I could not make that happen with what I had reserved‚Ä¶ but wait! I will be in Kusatsu Onsen for a night, I can have them deliver it there! We communicated, and in a few days I will have my Apple Pencil again; the cornerstone to a third of all of the college notes I‚Äôve written (bc paper notes take up physical space). Sadly, this meant I could not do anything in Sendai EXCEPT for a load of food stalls in the station plaza?! I gaze around before it settles on a booth with alcohol. I sample some local sake and wine? You heard that right, grape wine! This was a welcome surprise because I just started getting into wine this year. Now onto‚Ä¶ Utsunomiya! I‚Äôm here thanks to Jake Valiane's video on the city citing its notably hospitable bartenders. I peeped a shinkansen barrel through the station, before I spotted a lil light rail, just like home (minus the bullet train). Supper was decided to be a local specialty: gyoza! Coined in by the dog encased in one inside Utsunomiya Station, I head to 365 Gyoza Bar for some delectable gyoza. I have to admit, I am pretty ambivalent to dumpling-like things of [thing] encased in [carb casing], but those were nice! LODGING: Utsunomiya Tobu Hotel Grande. A really cheap hotel accessible by bus from the train station, I had a whole room with nice amenities. There was also a newspaper vending machine? I suppose people still read those. I used to once when I worked at a gas station in All-There-Is-Is-Corn, Minnesota. As someone who can only have 2 standard drinks maximum to not be sedated like someone shot by a tranquilizer, I had to choose my bar time carefully. Do I go to one bar having 2 drinks or two bars having 1 drink? I chose the one bar strat. In Bar Juice, we have a lovely bartender! He can speak good English, and we talked about our lives before a couple came in. This was a Sunday night, so the four of us shot the shit as I indulged in a seasonal strawberry cocktail and a matcha cocktail so me and the couple ordered the same two cocktails! This was perfect, not at all pretentious, and I would genuinely go here every night if I lived in the same city. The price was decent, the table charge snack plentiful, and I got a branded small set of matches to take home! 16k steps. **Day 7: Sake Country**: Turns out I keep yapping so I will try to summarize‚Ä¶ oops. It‚Äôs a huge reach of the day, taking the shinkansen from Utsunomiya to Gala Yuzawa to Niigata to Tokyo in one day! Gala Yuzawa is relevant so I can see snow, go into a small onsen, enjoy the footbath by Yuzawa Station, get complimented on my Japanese, and enjoy the sake vending machines inside the station! Niigata is obvious: Sake. I toured Imayotsukasa Sake Brewery and chatted with someone travelling from Finland! We enjoy the Niigata Station sake vending machines together before we go our own ways. Tokyo is back but so is Shinjuku?! HUUUUUH? That‚Äôs right, I got a 2nd reservation for Bar BenFiddich at 11PM. Drink 1 is something herbal: Wrymwood Gimlet. Drink 2 features Japanese ingredients: Smooth Matcha Old Fashioned. That cocktail was genuinely perfect, a touch of walnut liquor and coconut water making is extremely easy to drink. I would actually drink one every night if I could. Since me and a couple nearby were chatty, I got to try a Fernet and Bar BenFiddich‚Äôs Absinthe. I absolutely will return again. Lodging: Shinjuku Nikka. Here for something super cheap, a walkable distance, and easily accessed when the trains have stopped running. 14.6k steps. **Day 8: Wine Country**: By this point, I have successfully paid off the 7 Day Japan Rail Pass! You know what that means? Time to take a convenient Limited Express to the local Chuo Line to Katsunumabudokyo Station. A lovely trip, passing by the maglev shinkansen test track, we arrive at loads of vineyards and sakura! Super scenic!! This is a guaranteed HIGHLIGHT with how pretty the station looks in April. I spend time in Budou no Oka‚Äôs wine cave to indulge and sample on locally made wine~ I head on back and rest in my bed before eating mackerel ramen at Seafudou. Mmm, fish. I walk to Jimbocho to buy some doujins for me and a friend, walk to Ochanomizu for the train photospot, and walk next door to Akihabara. I spend more time playing Taiko no Tatsujin, and I drink a Sapporo before I sleep. 13.7k steps. **Day 9: Warm Sulfur Town**: I meet up with a friend and her mom at Ueno so we can take the JR Kusatsu Limited Express train + bus up to Kusatsu Onsen! By this point, I have not only paid off the Rail Pass, but the Green Car version. That‚Äôs right, I bought the Green Car version of the 7 Day Japan Rail Pass. I wanted to ensure I got guaranteed seats since I noticed that some trains were completely full when I went to Japan the month prior with my parents. LODGING: Kusatsu Onsen Eiyada! I have dinner there before I walk around town with my friend, going into baths along the way. I sleep to some Japanese TV. 9.5k steps. **Day 10: Cheesy Nightlife**: I see my friend off as she flies back this afternoon, and think over my plans as I go into the 4 increasingly hot baths in Otaki no Yu. I buy some grape juice and camembert from Karuizawa before taking the shinkansen to Omiya for the Railroad Museum! There was so much to see, and even more I could buy from the gift shop. A MUST VISIT if you are into trains even a little bit. Omiya Station also had something going on, so I sampled a couple sweet sake before making a snap choice to‚Ä¶ Return to Utsunomiya! Bar Juice was so good, I had to go again to give the bartender a bar of dark chocolate from Trader Joe‚Äôs I had brought with me on the trip. I also visit Bar Yamanoi (the one operated by the son, not the father bc there‚Äôs two) to try the Ryokubi! I love yuzu and muscat, what can I say? The shinkansen takes me back~ 17k steps. **Day 11: 25 Cour**: I skip breakfast as I wander around Tokyo Station for one key reason: 25 Course Omakase at Manten Sushi Nihonbashi for lunch. I just barely survived, but hot damn was everything really good! One minor gripe was that they did not tell you how much drinks cost and I found out when the bill arrived :p Around this point, I ran out of money in my bank account so I was rationing what little cash and IC card money I had. No, I did not buy the $200 four liter sized mango, but I really wanted to though‚Ä¶ I pop into Shibuya 109 for an Oshi no Ko pop up store before heading down to Enoshima Treasure Cafe for a Miss Kobayashi‚Äôs Dragon Maid collab cafe! With that being my #2 fav anime of all time, I had to go for the goodies. I went back up to Asakusabashi but not after trying to 100% Fatal on Normal Mode in Taiko. 12.2k steps **Day 12: Prince of Speed**: I furiously pack and keep my luggage waiting in the hostel before heading to Ikebukuro. Why there?? A Dungeon Meshi collab cafe of course. Somehow, I got a $400 refund from my university. Not sure HOW, but better late than never? I play Taiko one last time in Akihabara before I take my one train from Asakusabashi to HND Terminal 3. I unfortunately fell into the trap of making my checked bag too heavy, so I had to move 1 kg into my backpack. It almost always happens to my mom, and I thought it would never happen to me. Ah, well. Thanks to Face Express, instead of lining up in the long 100+ person line, I got to line up behind only about 20 instead, thanks Japan! I use the last of my cash and coins on 7-Eleven and vending machine stuff to have food on the flight all the way back to the Land of 1000 Lakes. I will return again next year! 8.7k steps pre-flight. Here is my Expense Spreadsheet, if you have any questions feel free to ask me and I will do my best to answer! I know this was a super ambitious and indulgent trip, but it was worth it for all the stories and pictures I can show and tell."}

We are a couple in our 30's from Europe and we are already planning our third trip for this fall. # Tokyo (4 nights, 3 days) * Ghibli Museum * Nakano Broadway * Akihabara * Shibuya * Harajuku * Korean Town in Shin-Okubo * Pok√©mon Center DX in Nihonbashi * Daytrip to Yokohama We stayed in **Ginza**, near a smaller metro station ‚Äì something I recommend, as it‚Äôs much easier to navigate than the big ones. For transportation in Tokyo we bought a **72-hour metro pass**, which was very convenient. JR lines aren‚Äôt included, but we only needed one JR ride during our stay. We also took a **day trip to Yokohama**, where we visited Chinatown, the strawberry festival, and the Pok√©mon Center in Marui City Yokohama. The mall also had a large second-hand store full of Pok√©mon plushies, and I even won a big Chansey in a claw machine. Chinatown‚Äôs food was a bit underwhelming for me ‚Äì but that might be because I‚Äôd visited China just a few months earlier, so my expectations were fresh and high. # Kawaguchiko (2 nights, 2 days) * Chureito Pagoda * Oishi Park * Lake Yamanaka * Gotemba Premium Outlets * Oshino Hakkai We took the bus to **Kawaguchiko** (the only bus/train we pre-booked during the trip), checked into our hotel, and explored Fuji-Q Highland in the afternoon. We really liked this park, it was chill and took many pictures at Naruto x Boruto hidden village of Konoha. In the evening, we picked up a rental car from **Budget Rent** ‚Äì a great experience ‚Äì so we could start early the next morning. Visiting **Chureito Pagoda** at 8 am was perfect: almost no one there, and Mt Fuji was crystal clear. We also visited a nearby waterfall, Oishi Park, and peaceful Lake Yamanaka, where we enjoyed fluffy pancakes at *The Park* caf√© (only a 10-minute wait). Later we drove to **Gotemba Premium Outlets**, where we bought an exclusive Mt Fuji Pikachu and some sneakers, then stopped at **Oshino Hakkai**, a traditional village with beautiful clear ponds. It was a bit touristy, but still charming. We were lucky to have Mt Fuji visible both days, and having a car made visiting all these spots much easier. # Nagano (2 nights, 2,5 days) * Jigokudani Monkey Park * Togakushi Shrine Okusha (Main Shrine) Zuishinmon We took the shinkansen to **Nagano** (about 4 hours) and had a relaxing evening. The next day we visited **Jigokudani Monkey Park** ‚Äì the snow monkeys were amazing, and the hike there was fun (but icy, so wear good shoes). In the evening, we enjoyed Korean BBQ and games at *Round 1*. The following day we took the bus to **Togakushi Shrine Okusha**, where the cedar trees were stunning. It‚Äôs worth seeing if you have time, but skippable if you‚Äôre on a tight schedule. That evening we took the train to Kanazawa. Nagano the city was pretty dull, so I wouldn't go back here anytime soon. # Kanazawa (2 nights, 1,5 day) * Omicho Market * Nagamachi Samurai District * Ishiura Shrine * Higashi Chaya District * Pokemon centre We started at Omicho market, which I loved. I ate a croquette there and then went upstairs. On the second floor there are many restaurants so you can sit down for a nice meal. I had the best kaisendon here. It rained all day, so we skipped Kenroku-en Garden. There‚Äôs a bus connecting al the touristic spots, but we walked everywhere (about 20 minutes between each). We enjoyed snacks along the way, and even with the rain, Kanazawa was beautiful ‚Äì I‚Äôll definitely return. # Fukui (1 day) * Fukui Dinosaur Museum * Echizen Daibutsu From Kanazawa, we took the train to **Fukui**. The Dinosaur Museum and Echizen Daibutsu were fantastic. Looking back, I wish we had rented a car here ‚Äì public transport was slow and infrequent, so we couldn‚Äôt fit much else in. In the evening, we took the train to Kyoto. # Kyoto (4 nights, 3 days) * Nintendo Museum (Uji) * Tenjuan Temple * Nanzenji Suirokaku * Kyoto City KYOCERA Museum of Art In Kyoto we took a trip to **Uji** to visit the new Nintendo Museum. Loved just strolling around Uji, it's peacefull and charming. The next day we bought an unlimited **bus &amp; metro pass** at Kyoto Station, which made getting around easy. we explored several temples and sights such as **Tenjuan Temple**, **Nanzenji Suirokaku**, and the **KYOCERA Museum of Art** ‚Äì this part of the city was almost tourist-free, which made it even better. Our last day, we had planned to drive to **Amanohashidate**, but rain was forecast, so we opted for a relaxed day in Kyoto eating and shopping. # Hotel booking tips I mostly book hotels through Trip and Agoda ‚Äì Booking isn‚Äôt always the cheapest in Asian countries. I always choose free cancellation, book at least 4 months in advance, and check weekly if prices drop. This approach gets us the best deals. On our first trip we stayed in pricier hotels, but this time we got equally good (or better) ones for less. # Total trip cost ‚Äì 2 weeks, 2 people (from Europe) **‚Ç¨4,050** total (excluding shopping) * Flights: ‚Ç¨1,357 * Accommodation (twin rooms): ‚Ç¨811 (‚Ç¨54/night on average) * Transport (trains, metros, buses, car rental): ‚Ç¨677 * Activities (entry tickets, etc.): ‚Ç¨150 * Food: ‚Ç¨1,120 (‚Ç¨80/day on average) * Shopping: ‚Ç¨900 (games, clothing, anime figures, Pok√©mon plush, souvenirs) We got cheap flights with China Eastern Airlines. On the way back, we had a long overnight stopover in Beijing. Since we had already visited Beijing before, we didn‚Äôt mind spending another evening there. China Eastern offers a free hotel stay in some cities. We arrived at 4 pm, took a Didi (taxi) to the hotel, dropped off our stuff, and went out to explore the city. The next morning we could sleep in, stroll around a park, check out, and head back to the airport. The hotel keeps your checked luggage for you, so the whole process is really easy and stress-free. If you have any questions, let me know!"}
{"id": "2fd47e8e0960438ecfd5f810", "title": "Trip Report: Autumn in Japan", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mneev9/trip_report_autumn_in_japan/", "date": "2025-08-11", "subreddit": "r/JapanTravel", "author": "Azrou", "score": 219, "num_comments": 32, "text": "My wife had to go to Tokyo for work last November, so I flew in on her last day of meetings and we spent the next 12 days traveling along the north side of Honshu, down to Kyoto, over to Fukuoka, and back to Tokyo. I had a new camera and lens setup so was really excited to capture the fall colors. Suffice to say that Japan was absolutely gorgeous at this time of year, and I think fall might be my favorite time to visit. Hope this report will be helpful to others looking to do a similar trip. We‚Äôre in our 30s and experienced travelers. This was actually our third trip to Japan in 2024 ‚Äì once to go skiing at Niseko early in the year, and once in the spring for cherry blossoms ‚Äì but we lived in Asia at the time and had moved back to the U.S. in the summer. Time tends to be more of a constraint than money, and we like to be comfortable while traveling without going crazy on luxury hotels and the like. We tend to fill out the schedule without a lot of downtime and don‚Äôt mind long days. **Some logistical notes:** - Hotels ‚Äì I made about half our reservations on Booking and the other half directly. - Internet ‚Äì I have a Google Fi phone plan and high speed data was seamless as soon as I landed. My wife rented a hotspot from a kiosk at the airport since she arrived earlier. - IC cards ‚Äì Not sure if Suica card availability is still an issue (maybe at the airport?), but I had no problem getting them at Tokyo Station. - Trains ‚Äì I think it has been well covered here, but since the price increase, the JR Pass wasn‚Äôt worth it and I bought all our train tickets individually. I booked Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen tickets on SmartEx and linked our Suica cards to the tickets. The app is pretty clunky, feels like an early 2000s interface and can be buggy with accepting some credit cards. Regardless I was able to link a Chase Visa card and it got the job done. - Maps ‚Äì Download offline maps on Google just in case. Interestingly, Google would sometimes give different directions on my phone (Android) than my wife‚Äôs (iPhone). Generally mine seemed to be more accurate and quicker, especially when transferring on multiple trains/buses. Would also suggest grabbing an app called Organic Maps and getting offline maps on that. It uses data from OpenStreetMap and has a lot more granular detail on certain things like hiking trails. - Car rental ‚Äì A bit more of an arduous process than in any other country I‚Äôve visited. Rented one car in Kanazawa from Nissan and another in Fukuoka from Avis through their websites. Make sure you understand exactly what documentation is needed and bring hard copies. For most foreign driver‚Äôs licenses, you need an International Driving Permit. In the U.S. these are only issued by AAA and are valid for one year. There were some other quirks like needing to fill up the fuel before return at specific approved gas stations within a certain radius of the car rental office, and showing the agent the timestamped receipt. Anecdotally, the Nissan was a newer car with better features like integrated Android Auto. The Avis car ‚Äì a Honda Fit, I believe - was a bit older and more basic. **Day 1 ‚Äì Tokyo** Landed in the afternoon, got a ticket for the Narita Express at the airport, rode to Tokyo Station, and checked in at the Hotel Monterey Ginza. My wife had been at a hotel in Shinjuku for work so she moved her bags over. I saw on socials that an old friend was also on vacation in Japan, and in an incredible coincidence, it turns out she was staying at the exact same hotel. The three of us went for a sushi dinner at the Mitsukoshi in Ginza. Afterwards, we met up with another couple that we‚Äôre good friends with who happened to be in Tokyo on their own trip, and stopped at a sake bar. **Day 2 ‚Äì Kurobe Gorge** Took the Hokuriku Shinkansen to Kurobe and transferred to a local train to Unazukionsen. It‚Äôs a tiny place, so everything is within walking distance. We rode the Kurobe Gorge Railway and were rewarded with spectacular views. The gorge walls are steep, so I think the optimal timing is between 10am and 2pm when you‚Äôll have fewer shadows. Try sitting on the right side leaving Unazukionsen and the left side for the return trip to get the best views. There are multiple vantage points in town where you‚Äôll find iconic views of the rail bridges. Rail service was only to Nekomata because of damage from an earthquake in 2024, but the route beyond Nekomata to Kanetsuri and Keyakidaira is supposed to re-open some time in 2025. Back in town we went to a konbini to grab dinner and were surprised to find a troop of monkeys. There were about 25-30 in total wandering around foraging like they owned the place. We stayed at a ryokan called the Unazukionsen Yamanoha and I didn‚Äôt see a single other foreigner there. It‚Äôs a larger ryokan but still quite traditional ‚Äì I have a few tattoos and asked the staff if I would be able to use the onsen, to which they politely said it wasn‚Äôt possible. I wasn‚Äôt surprised but a bit disappointed as it hadn‚Äôt been an issue on previous trips to Niseko and Hakuba. There is an option to reserve a private onsen for 1650 yen to get around this though. **Day 3 ‚Äì Kanazawa** Dropped our bags at the Daiwa Roynet Kanazawa Miyabi next to the main station in the morning. We spent the day exploring the city, starting off at Kenrokuen which is renowned as one of Japan‚Äôs Three Great Gardens. It rained off and on throughout the day but we got lucky and the clouds parted for a bit. The gardens are absolutely serene, and there‚Äôs even a small waterfall feeding one of the ponds. Before leaving Kenrokuen we stopped at Seisonkaku and then made the short walk to Kanazawa Castle. In the afternoon we took a bus to the tea district, Higashi Chaya, and sampled some teas and Japanese desserts at Sabo Issho. There were some things we missed like the geisha experience and Nagamachi samurai district, so I hope to get back to Kanazawa in the future. Note that the city buses don‚Äôt accept Suica cards ‚Äì we had to pay cash. **Day 4 - Gassho-zukuri Villages** Picked up a rental car and spent the whole day visiting these UNESCO World Heritage sites. It was overcast and drizzling most of the time which created a wonderful fall atmosphere. Started in Ainokura, the smallest of the three villages. We mostly had the village to ourselves, which would not be the case later ‚Äì especially at Shirakawa! There are a few short trails in the hills around the village that we explored before moving on to Suganuma. The traditional thatched roofs are remarkable. We got to Shirakawa around 2pm and had to wait about 45 minutes just to get in the parking lot. This is the largest of the three villages by far and has some food options and souvenir shops. We wrapped up right as they were closing down at dusk and headed back to Kanazawa. There are dozens of tour buses dropping people off throughout the day, so if I had to redo our itinerary I‚Äôd have gone to Shirakawa first to try and beat the crowds. This was a Saturday and a holiday (Labor Thanksgiving Day) to boot which probably exacerbated things. **Day 5 ‚Äì Kyoto** Over to Kyoto where we left our things at the Granbell Hotel before heading out. Most of the day was spent north of the city at Kuramadera. It is a long uphill walk to the temple that takes maybe 90 minutes depending on how often you pause to take in the beautiful pathway and shrines that dot the mountainside. The crowds thin out towards the top where you have the option of returning the same way back to Kurama station or taking a trail down the other side of the mountain. We opted for the latter and found a friend before stopping at Kifune Shrine. I was not expecting Kifune to be such a big attraction, but there were absolute hordes of people there. The walk down to Kibuneguchi station is another 20-30 minutes on a paved road next to a stream with more gorgeous scenery. That night we met up with my friend from the sushi dinner in Tokyo to see the night illumination at Nijo Castle. There are better night illuminations in Kyoto to see the fall colors, but I hadn‚Äôt been to Nijo Castle before so it was a good way to end the day. **Day 6 ‚Äì Kyoto** My wife was drained from the last few days so she grabbed a few extra hours of sleep while I woke up early and headed to Fushimi Inari. We‚Äôve both been there before but experiencing the sunrise was a different experience altogether. I made it to the top around 7:15am, and by 7:30am the lighting was perfect. After a bit of time hanging out with the foxes and taking in the scenery, I continued on to the ‚Äúsecret bamboo trail‚Äù and got back to the entrance at 9am where people were streaming in by the hundreds. I met up with my wife at Enkoji, which may be my favorite temple in Kyoto proper now. Enkoji was founded by Tokugawa Ieyasu, made famous in the West as the deuteragonist in the Shogun book (my favorite novel) and recent TV series (an excellent adaptation), in the 1600s. It requires advance registration, which helps to keep the crowds manageable, and tickets cost 1000 yen. The rock garden at the entrance gives way to a tranquil tree garden with stone lanterns and other ornaments. One of the highlights is a Jizo statue in the central garden. Walk up further and you‚Äôll find a small bamboo forest, a cemetery, and some nice views of Kyoto. We moved on to the Philosopher‚Äôs Path and on a whim ducked into Hakusasonso. The entrance fee was a bit steep at 1300 yen, but this private garden was almost entirely deserted ‚Äì the only people we saw was a couple doing an engagement or wedding photo shoot. Honenin and Shinnyodo are both free and were relatively uncrowded. The central pagoda at Shinnyodo dominates the courtyard. As late afternoon approached, we found ourselves at Nanzenji. It‚Äôs free to enter, but I think it was worth the 600 yen fee to get an elevated vantage point at Sammon Gate. Nanzenji is also notable for the photogenic Suirokaku Aqueduct. Rather than exit through the main entrance, you can take a hidden path from the aqueduct to leave from the back which will take you to Keage station. After getting dinner downtown, we retraced our steps to see Eikando at night for 700 yen. This has a well-deserved reputation as one of the most impressive night illuminations in Kyoto, and the crown jewel is Hojo Pond. Although it is very popular, we found the temple had quieted down a lot by the time we got there at 8pm and it was a really pleasant walk through the grounds. **Day 7 ‚Äì Kyoto** I had gone back and forth on whether to visit Tofukuji. Tsutenkyo Bridge is known as THE place to see the leaves turning, but I‚Äôd seen some horror stories about how packed it can get and a ban on photos to keep people moving and avoid dangerous situations. There is a way to get an early admission ticket to enter an hour before it opens to the general public, but I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to navigate the system ‚Äì I think you may need to be a resident of Japan. My wife convinced me to go anyway, and is usually the case, she made a great call. Tsutenkyo was not nearly as bad as I feared, and if you are patient you‚Äôll get plenty of time to enjoy the colors and take all the photos you want. Tofukuji is free although there is a 1000 yen fee for Tsutenkyo. Next we had gave our feet a break with a workshop at Yamada Tatami. I‚Äôd seen it recommended on other posts here, and this was one of the highlights of the trip. The shop owner‚Äôs son, Masaki-san, leads the demonstration and helps you make a small souvenir tatami to take as a keepsake. Traditional tatami is a dying craft in Japan so we were happy to support the business. It was easy to book online, and the shop assistant Cheryl-san translates everything into English and will take a bunch of photos and share them afterwards. We then headed to the monkey park in Arashiyama. By the time we got there it was raining steadily, and we weren‚Äôt sure whether it was worth the 600 yen and a long uphill walk if the monkeys would all be taking shelter. Turns out that they don‚Äôt give a crap about the weather and go about their business rain or shine. I had to admire the tenacity of even the youngest members of the troop. Before turning in for the night I stopped in Gion, where the drizzling rain gave it an ethereal atmosphere. **Day 8 ‚Äì Fukuoka** Took the Shinkansen south and checked in at the JR Kyushu Hotel Blossom Hakata Chuo midday. After lunch, we visited the Ishikura Sake Brewery. They don‚Äôt offer tours but there is a showroom of sorts where you can get free samples and ‚Äútry before you buy.‚Äù We killed the rest of the afternoon at teamLab Forest (2400 yen) before going to the Kamado Shrine in Dazaifu, which does a night illumination during the fall. This is very much off the beaten path in a sleepy area on the outskirts of Fukuoka. The shrine is often visited by couples and people looking for love. Entrance is free but the transportation options become pretty limited late at night. We had to wait at the entrance for about 15 minutes before my wife was able to get a taxi through an app (GO). **Day 9 ‚Äì Interior of Kyushu** Picked up a rental car and drove to the Akizuki Castle ruins on our way to Onta Pottery Village. Closer to Onta we made a quick stop at some rice terraces where the clouds cleared up at the perfect time. I had a bit of a tricky time getting into Onta as there are only two roads in, and one was closed but not marked on Google Maps. Ontayaki pottery is all handmade to this day, with ten families passing down knowledge from generation to generation. There is a free museum where you can learn about the history of the village before visiting the workshops along the main road. Interestingly, none of the families sign their ceramics because they maintain a collective identity. We capped the night off at Citadel, a cocktail bar full of character that has attracted attention after appearing in a NYT piece about the culinary scene in Fukuoka. **Day 10 ‚Äì Tokyo** We decided to leave Ohori Park for another trip and hopped on the Shinkansen up to Tokyo. I got first class tickets (the ‚Äúgreen car‚Äù) since they were only a bit more than regular tickets. The green car isn‚Äôt vastly different from economy other than being in a 2x2 configuration where you can reserve seats, and I wanted to sit on the left side to see Fujisan. JR scaled back dining options on the Shinkansen a few years ago, but in the green car you can still order drinks and snacks to your seat through a QR code. The selection is pretty basic, but it‚Äôs a good fallback option to get coffee or tea and a light meal if you don‚Äôt have time to stop at a konbini before boarding. We checked in at the Hotel Wing International Premium Tokyo Yotsuya, then after dinner saw the superb night illumination on Meiji Jingu Gaien Ginkgo Avenue. The upper half of the road is closed to vehicles in the evening and the lights go off at precisely 7:30pm. **Day 11 ‚Äì Mount Takao and Tokyo** This time it was my turn to convince my wife to tackle Takaosan. It was a Saturday and fairly crowded, but the weather was ideal. You can do a steep hike from Takaosanguchi station or take a cable car partway up, which was about a 45-minute wait. On the way to the top you can make wishes/prayers and appreciate the figurines on the hillside. The summit offers unparalleled views of Tokyo. The cable car return to the train station had a massive line so we opted to walk all the way down. At night we went to teamLab Planets (4200 yen) and got dinner at the Ippudo in the mall next to Shinjuku station, which is notable for offering vegan ramen. **Day 12 ‚Äì Tokyo and departure** On our last day my wife peeled off to do some shopping while I went to see Meiji Jingu Gaien Ginkgo Avenue in daylight. Our flight was departing from Haneda that afternoon but I also squeezed in a visit to Shinjuku Gyoen (500 yen), a peaceful oasis tucked in between Tokyo‚Äôs high-rises. After a last few moments admiring the massive ginkgo trees, it was off to the airport and back to real life."}

This summer I solo-traveled to Japan for the second time this year. My first trip was back in March ‚Äî one week in Tokyo ‚Äî and I loved it so much I had to come back. This time, I went for 17 days from late July to early August. Yes, it‚Äôs hot and humid in summer, but honestly, I still really enjoyed the trip. I just had to take more breaks along the way. I started my trip in Kyoto, staying for the first two nights at Hotel SUI Kyoto Kiyomizu. For the low price of this hotel, I got a comfortable stay with free sakae and udon during certain hours. They also had shaved ice and matcha making activities, but I didn‚Äôt join. Location-wise, it wasn‚Äôt the most convenient, as the nearest convenience store was across a main road, but there was a nearby train station with a direct line to Fushimi Inari. On my first full day, I ambitiously visited Fushimi Inari (hiking all the way to the peak), Nara, and Uji in one day. It was great, but I‚Äôm pretty sure this marathon day led to the blisters and swelling in my feet that stayed with me for the rest of the trip. For the next two nights, I moved to Sora Niwa Terrace Kyoto Bettei. I specifically chose the *Bettei* version for the in-room natural hot spring onsen, which was amazing after a day of walking. The mini-fridge was stocked daily with complimentary drinks, and the rooftop terrace offered unlimited drinks during certain hours. My stay included breakfast with a different menu each day. The location was excellent ‚Äî just off the main street full of restaurants and shops ‚Äî and it was Gion Matsuri while I was there, with festivities almost right outside the hotel. The only small downside was that the nearest convenience store was still across the street. Next, I headed to Osaka for four nights at Rex Inn Namba, chosen mainly for affordability since prices were high due to the Expo. The location wasn‚Äôt the closest to the main Namba area, but there was a convenience store right behind the hotel. A unique perk was the option to order convenience store items and have them delivered directly to your room. The hotel itself had an older style, with physical room keys that had to be handed in at reception whenever you went out, but the process was quick and never inconvenient. Complimentary drinks were available all day, and breakfast included free pancakes and eggs. One highlight in Osaka was attending the Tenjin Matsuri fireworks. I arrived an hour early, and while it was crowded, it was still manageable. However, even leaving before the finale, I still had to navigate huge crowds at the station, though it was well-managed. Going alone did feel a little lonely, seeing most people in yukata with friends and family, and this experience made me decide to skip the other fireworks festivals I had planned for Tokyo and Yokohama. From there, I traveled to Nagoya for two nights, staying at Hotel Actel Nagoya Nishiki. The location was great, with both a train station and convenience store nearby, though it was in a nightlife district. I didn‚Äôt have any noise issues, though. Nagoya‚Äôs food was a highlight ‚Äî Yabaton‚Äôs miso katsu was rich and flavorful, and the hitsumabushi at Atsuta Horaiken was absolutely worth it. Finally, I spent my last six nights in Tokyo at APA Hotel Shinjuku-Kabukicho Tower. It was a typical APA experience ‚Äî compact rooms and a very central location, however it won't be the closest to the train station. Being near Kabukicho meant plenty of food options, and I‚Äôd recommend trying Tsurutontan for udon, where you can get up to three servings at no extra cost. I also had an excellent authentic burger in Akasaka, based on recommendations from others. One tip I‚Äôd like to share: if the summer heat is getting to you and you‚Äôre far from your hotel or waiting for check-in, head to a Kaikatsu Club. It‚Äôs an internet caf√© chain with strong air conditioning, private booths to rest, free drinks and ice cream, and even showers to freshen up. Overall, I‚Äôd say traveling in Japan during summer is not as bad as people make it out to be. If you pace yourself, rest often, and stay hydrated, you can still have a fantastic time. I‚Äôd say ‚Äî just go for it!"}

Our stats: First-timers to Japan, Family of 4 with 12 and 17 year-old girls, from San Francisco (meaning unable to handle hot weather but used to city living and walking). Day 1 - SFO to Narita. Opted to stay in Ueno due to recommendation I saw on Reddit. This was a great move as we were able to take the Narita Skyliner to Ueno in just 40 minutes. There are a few ways to buy these tickets and YouTube videos are helpful to see where you need to go and how the fares work. In the end, we did not prebook anything and simply bought them from the ticket office staffed by a human. Very easy and only a short wait. We opted for the &amp;HERE hotel, which is a 5-7 minute walk from the Ueno station and directly across the street from Ueno park. they have contactless check in and our 4-person room had a small kitchen, table and bunks for our kids. Plenty of room and within easy walking distance of food, Ueno park and the Ameyoko area under the railway tracks. many options to help us stay awake until dark. Day 2 - Explore by foot- Yanaka for ‚ÄúOld Tokyo‚Äù vibe, Ueno, and arcades and shopping in Ameyoko. 5 days on the Izu Peninsula. Train to from Ueno station to Shimoda, with a nice break/train switch in Atami. Lots of food options in a shopping complex connected to the train station. Rented car to get to AirB&amp;B in Sotoura Beach, just outside of Shimoda. Car rental ended up being great idea as there are a lot of small towns and beaches to explore. The car provided flexibility and it was not difficult to drive/park. We had obtained our international drivers permits in advance at AAA ($20 fee). The Izu peninsula has lovely beaches (Shirahama, Irata, Sotoura, Tatadohama) and clear, refreshing water. This is a popular tourist spot for Japanese later in the summer, but in June it‚Äôs still pretty quiet. We had a paddle board lesson and recommend the cafe IRIE Coffee &amp; Sea in Shirahama. The owner is a surfer and makes great smoothies. Also recommend FermenCo pizza at Irata Beach - you can make a reservation online (in English) and skip the line! 3 days in Kyoto. We stayed at an Airb&amp;b near the Fushiri Inari shrine. This made it very easy on the day we visited the shrine, but it was otherwise a little out of the way for seeing other parts of Kyoto. Nishiki market and the nearby outdoor shopping streets/malls were a big hit with our girls. We also had fun in Round 1 (video games, bowling etc). There was a more obvious tourist presence in Kyoto, especially in Gion. 2 days at Kinosaki Onsen for traditional ryokan experience. Easy train ride from Kyoto (2.5 hours on Express). We stayed at Onishiya Suishien and opted to do the traditional meal service (breakfast and dinner), and take advantage of the free passes provided by the hotel to visit the seven public Onsens in the area. This was a great way to relax after the bustle of Kyoto shopping, and the hotel also had free e-bikes that we could use to explore the town and greater area, including biking to see the Japan Sea. The biking was a highlight for our girls, one of their favorite parts of the trip! 5 days - Tokyo. It was a longer travel day from Kinosaki Onsen to Tokyo but it was a great opportunity to take the Shinkansen (about 5.5 hours total, transferring in Kyoto). We also enjoyed being in a completely different area of Tokyo. I can‚Äôt do Tokyo justice in this post, there is simply so much to do but if you have time to stay in two parts of the city, I recommend it. On this leg we explored: Shibuya, Harajuku (teen fave), Daikanyama, Ebisu, Ropponga, Diver City (to see Gundam robot, then unplanned stop at science museum because the nearby malls were super crowded). Specific activities included Disneyland and Teamlab Borderless. These activities were fun and we are able to get tickets a day or so in advance. We debated Disneyland due to concerns about crowds and heat but opted to arrive later in the afternoon and just strolled in! Many of the rides only had 5-10 minute waits (longest wait was 40 min) and there was a nice breeze and it cooled off in the evening. Having been to Disneyland in California a number of times the Tokyo version seemed small in comparison but it was a low key and fun addition to our itinerary. Highlights and learnings: -Appreciated the Japanese culture and found everyone to be incredibly friendly, helpful and polite. Japan is very clean and I felt completely safe everywhere we went. We were able to let our kids have some independence in the smaller towns to walk around on their own. -June is rainy season and also pretty warm. This year there was significantly less rain than normal so we only saw rain in Kyoto and it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. The clear plastic umbrellas are readily available at stores or hotels and are better than rain gear as you stay cool and can leave them outside of shops. The heat was another matter. Most days were between high 80s/low to mid-90s F (sometimes up to 97/98) with high humidity. This was quite challenging for us, especially when we were in cities, as we live in a mild climate with low humidity. For those who have more resilience to heat, this may not be a big deal at all. Everywhere has AC and the evenings are pretty pleasant so we found ourselves spending more time in museums or indoor malls during the day. The weather was great for the beach in Izu Peninsula. -We used taxis much more than planned, in both Kyoto and Tokyo. We didn‚Äôt realize Uber is readily available in both locations. There are Japanese taxi apps that are likely cheaper and work equally well. I believe all the apps connect you to real taxi drivers (this was at least the case with Uber). You could always get a cab within 3 minutes and for us this offered a few advantages that made taxis worth it: escape from heat, quiet/no crowds so could offer some recovery between activities while seeing the sights from the car, no language barrier. I‚Äôm sure more expensive but we did have a group of 4 at all times. -I regretted not learning more Japanese phrases before the trip. Everyone we met with willing to work with translation app or hand gestures if they didn‚Äôt speak English. -I had read the advice many times that it‚Äôs worth learning how the trains work in advance of the trip. We didn‚Äôt heed this advice so made some time-consuming errors by relying only on google maps in the moment. We didn‚Äôt understand Green Cars or how you combine base fares with additional tickets. We eventually figured it all out but learned to work with humans at the stations when buying tickets instead of just guessing. Larger stations in the city are busy and crowded, so plan for extra time. -You do need to have some cash. We experienced cash-only restaurants in all cities we visited. -Our younger daughter has a nut allergy, so it was extremely helpful to have pre-printed cards with an explanation of that allergy in English and Japanese. We found these online and used 10-15 cards throughout the trip. It‚Äôs helpful to have a physical piece of paper that can be taken back to the kitchen if needed, and we didn‚Äôt get them all back. Many restaurants have detailed lists of what allergens are present in each menu item. It was such a memorable trip, I would definitely travel to Japan again during a cooler time of year."}

My husband and I are experienced Japan travelers specifically, having visited 44 and 45 prefectures respectively, but this trip sticks to sights mainly on the western part of the golden route due to my mom, who really wanted to see Kyoto (she visited Tokyo enough for her taste when my husband and I lived there). We tend to focus on historical sights and museums, local food (and beloved chains), and shopping for local mascot characters. Having done most of the classic sights in this region, we deprioritized a lot of them. It‚Äôs entirely possible to do more stuff than we did in a day, but it was between 90 and 100 degrees F almost every day with high humidity, and my mom had a bad reaction to a knee treatment right before leaving, limiting her mobility for a while. And then we all got sick. It was a great trip, but definitely not a packed itinerary. This did get long because I have a lot to say in the hopes that someone might find it useful, so I ended up splitting it into two parts. The Matsuyama and Kyoto parts will come in the second post, once I get around to fleshing out my outline. A few logistics notes: We all have physical suicas picked up from previous trips. All transit except the boat to Matsuyama, the buses in Asuka and the airport bus were paid for with suica. The only prebooked train was the shinkansen between Osaka and Hiroshima, using SmartEx. My husband and I speak Japanese, my mother does not. **Thursday 7/10 - Osaka** We landed in KIX directly from the US, rather than having to fly to Tokyo first and transfer. We got through customs procedures in about 40 minutes, largely because I picked the slowest moving line. Then we hopped on the train and made our way to the Red Roof in Namba. Normally we don‚Äôt pick western chains when in Japan, but I guess we got a deal. Definitely a Japanese business hotel with western branding, though. Generally on our first night we buy toothpaste, but the nearest convenience store had been raided, so we spent way too long wandering around Namba trying to find one that was less picked over. And then trying to find sweat-proof sunscreen. Eventually, we accomplished our missions and collapsed. **Friday 7/11 - Osaka** We slept in out of respect for jet lag and ate convenience store bread for breakfast (true most days). My mom meanwhile decided to test herself and got a breakfast sandwich at the hotel next door. Once we were all combobulated, we decided for an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù day at Osaka castle. This ended up being hubris. We last went to Osaka castle in 2016, as part of a two castle day with Nagoya back in the halcyon days of the JR pass being a good deal. At the time, I assumed my feet hurt so much afterward because‚Ä¶ well, we did two castles in two cities on one day. I forgot that Osaka castle‚Äôs park is huge, and they added shuttle ‚Äúbuses‚Äù to get around the park for a reason. We hit 10,000 steps before lunch. We opted not to buy tickets in advance, which meant waiting in line for the ticket machines for maybe 10 minutes. The line was covered, which is an innovation I wish they‚Äôd implement at Niagara Falls, but that‚Äôs a rant for another subreddit. The castle ticket includes admission to the small, recently opened castle wall museum, which we hadn‚Äôt been to before. Where the castle itself was slammed with people and it could be hard to get to some of the exhibits, the castle wall museum was quiet and cool. There‚Äôs not much there, but if you want a break from the crowds and the heat, it‚Äôs right there. It‚Äôs also got great english. From there we decided to get lunch at the Osaka Gourmet Expo, which was on the grounds of the park, but actually pretty far from the castle. We ended up walking the full circumference to get back to the Osaka History museum, so in hindsight I might have chosen to have lunch closer to the history museum if only to spare my mom some walking. The Gourmet Expo itself is a collection of stalls that you order from via QR code. The food was good (okonomiyaki for me and my mom, beef bowl for my husband), but I don‚Äôt like QR code ordering. If you don‚Äôt speak Japanese, it‚Äôs probably more convenient, though. After that was the Osaka History museum, which doesn‚Äôt seem to have changed since 2016. Plentiful english, and my mom enjoyed the intro to Osaka‚Äôs history. But the heat had drained us pretty badly at this point, so after navigating the dungeons of Namba station to find the 551 Horai (steamed buns), we retired to the hotel to rest until dinner. My mom ended up staying in for the rest of the night for her knee. My husband and I got different regional katsu bowls at nearby Miyamoto Munashi, and then popped over to Den Den Town for a little shopping. This was interrupted by sudden, heavy rain, and I dipped after two stores. My number one Japan tip: always carry a collapsable umbrella. **Saturday 7/12 - Asuka** My husband has been wanting to visit Asuka over in Nara prefecture for years because he‚Äôs a fan of kofuns - japanese burial mounds. He thought he had it figured out perfectly. We would walk less and take buses everywhere, because the buses are more frequent on Saturdays. This is true‚Ä¶ in April and May. For those two months, they run extra buses on Saturdays. Otherwise, they‚Äôre once an hour. So we bought a day pass for the buses, but I‚Äôm not sure we ended up breaking even in the end. In Asuka, we visited the Asuka History Museum first. It was light on English, but introduced a lot of the interesting artifacts from the area and the historical sites. We ended up getting lunch at a plant based food spot outside of the Asuka Museum of Manyo Culture, which was better than expected but small. They also ran out of food after we ordered so clearly if you need plant based food in Asuka go here early. The museum itself was pretty immersive with good english explanations, I would recommend it! The focus is on song and poetry, and even if you can‚Äôt understand the songs, you can definitely feel them. After this we hopped on the bus to the Takamatsuzuka tumulus park, and specifically the mural museum within the park. Genuinely very cool, both in terms of vibes and temperature. The tomb found here had colorful murals inside, which is pretty uncommon in tombs from this period. We could have walked around the park more, and I guess the thing to do is actually to bike it, but heat and pain were winning, so we took the bus back to the station, and trained back to Osaka. We had to make a poorly indicated train transfer (if you don‚Äôt speak Japanese), but luckily it was cross platform and I was paying attention, so we made it. My mom wanted okonomiyaki for dinner, so I found Fukutarou in Namba station, and remembered it being recommended somewhere. Possibly here? There was a short wait, and they were clearly prepared to try and do everything through gestures up until I revealed that I speak Japanese. My mom tried the negiyaki and liked it, but my husband found the okonomiyaki under-sauced and with not enough ginger. As with everything, ymmv, I liked it. After dinner, we took a break until dark, and took a walk through Dotonbori. I‚Äôve always avoided it because I‚Äôm not one for crowds and nightlife, but it was worth doing once, at least as a fan of the yakuza games. It‚Äôs totally possible to take a walk down the canal without being sardined, once you get past the lines for the boat rides anyway. **Sunday 7/13 - Osaka** We started the day with a pretty niche set of shrine and temple visits: one in honor of Sanada Yukimura, and the other on the former site of the Sanadamaru. Almost no english, really only interesting if you‚Äôre into this particular sengoku period warlord. Or if you want to see the alleged tunnel to Osaka castle. The next stop was the Museum of Housing and Living, which my husband and I had done before, but thought my mom would be interested in. She loved it, so, win. If coming by subway, the museum is easy to find and well signed from within the tunnels. We came by JR years ago, had to find it on the street, and ended up having to ask for directions. So take the subway. One thing about this museum, the permanent exhibition after the model town relies on QR codes for their multilingual information, which I feel really slows down the flow of visiting a museum. Now, the big mistake of this day. We forgot about the expo. Specifically, that it was Sunday, and many people might choose to take the Chuo Line to the expo on their day off. But we bought advance tickets to Kaiyukan for my mom, and we had a 1 pm slot. So we crammed ourselves onto the Chuo line and assured ourselves that the mall at Tempozan was still a great place to get lunch. We ended up getting takeout from a katsu restaurant in the mall, eating them in a back corner of the old Osaka nostalgia alley. And it was honestly really good! But the place was a zoo, and we should have known better. The true pain was getting out, though. I think it took us four trains before one came out of Yumeshima with enough space for us to get on, which was another lesson learned. Expo traffic does exist, mainly on the Chuo line, especially near the western end, mainly on weekends. Plan accordingly. My mom really enjoyed Kaiyukan, she got a go pro basically for this purpose. But it's gotten kind of expensive and they surge price, so I don't suggest just showing up without planning. Once free of the Chuo line, we checked out the pokemon center in Shinsaibashi and my mom bought luggage (we were all carry on only to this point). We walked back to Namba by way of 551 Horai, Pablo cheese tarts, and my favorite stamina-meshi chain, Sutadonya. Despite being in Dotonbori, at 5 pm, it was easy to get a seat. If you like garlic, this is the place to totally ruin your ability to detect low levels of it. We got an early night, anticipating an early train to Hiroshima. **Monday 7/14- Osaka to Hiroshima** In hindsight, we would not have booked shinkansen tickets that required us to take the Midosuji line during rush hour with all of our stuff. It was probably the one time having our luggage on the train felt like a significant inconvenience. Also, apparently this line doesn‚Äôt always go all the way to Shin-Osaka during this time, so plan accordingly. After a painless shinkansen to Hiroshima, we dropped our bags at the Universal Hotel Hiroshima, which was definitely an older business hotel than I expected. Last renovation probably in the 80s, but it had free breakfast and free dinner (we opted for just the breakfast). We got lunch at an udon place in the station, before taking the tram to the peace park. It rained all day. This lowered the temperature somewhat, but we had to detour to buy my mom an umbrella. The gift shop at the Orizuru tower sold some, so you‚Äôre never far from somewhere to buy one. It would have been nice to take more time to explore the park, but the weather didn‚Äôt encourage us to linger. We sought shelter in the Atomic Bomb Memorial Museum, along with every other tourist in Hiroshima, it felt like. I don‚Äôt know what they can do to improve crowd control other than decrease the number of tickets sold, but I think they need to do it. Several sections are very narrow with a lot of text to read, and everyone wants to stop to read, of course they do! But it felt very crowded, and I‚Äôm convinced this is where we got sick. It‚Äôs an important museum, and I understand why they don‚Äôt want to limit visitors, but the crowding really doesn‚Äôt encourage you to take your time and absorb everything. There are a couple of other small museums in the park, like one about the G7 summit held in Hiroshima, and a preserved section of ruins. There‚Äôs also a memorial for those who died in the bombing, with a lot of personal stories from survivors. It‚Äôs heavy stuff, which is probably why our next stop was the Hiroshima pokemon center for a palate cleanser. This is probably the pokemon center with the greatest number of unique regional pikachus, so it‚Äôs more worth visiting than some of the others. One of those Pikachus is definitely a Carp fan, lmao. We got dinner at a restaurant in the station that specialized in local Hiroshima cuisine. **Tuesday 7/15 - Hiroshima** We started Tuesday by hopping on the Maple Loop bus, which I think Kyoto should consider stealing. A bus that loops between the major tourist spots, with multiple languages and sight-seeing specific info? Great way to get tourists off the regular buses. Anyway, we took it to Hiroshima castle, which is similar to Osaka castle in that it‚Äôs a reconstruction with a history museum inside. Worth visiting, if only to see some of the trees on the grounds, which not only survived the atomic bombing, but went on to thrive. I found that surprisingly meaningful. We got an early lunch at an Onomichi ramen place that was 1. Really cheap 2. Really good 3. Had absolutely massive karaage. Great deal, no notes. After that we made our way to Shukkeien, taking our time strolling through the garden. We saw crabs! Once my mom started to tire, we opted to head back to the hotel to rest, as we had tickets to a Carp game that night. One of the coolest things for me about the Carp game was the walk to the stadium, which has a ton of carp themed manhole covers and businesses that change their normal brand colors. There's a red Lawson, a red Toyoko Inn, etc. And the merchandise is everywhere. I think my mom bought multiple Carp shirts by the end of our time in Hiroshima, and I bought one for myself. The atmosphere at the game was really cool too, for all that it was a weekday night. The stands ended up filling quite a bit, even though the game ended up being a 0-1 loss. No one gave up until the very end, and I didn't see the kind of leaving early to catch the train that I saw in Tokyo or Osaka. **Wednesday 7/16 - Iwakuni** We spent a very hot day in Iwakuni, taking in the sights on the far side of the Kintaikyo bridge, which is a sight in itself. The castle is another reconstruction, but the view is gorgeous, and it was much cooler up there than it was on ground level. There are a couple of interesting little museums in the area, like the White Snake museum, and an art museum. Tickets to these museums are discounted when you buy the joint ticket at the bridge, which covers crossing the bridge, the ropeway, and the castle. We retired early because it was hot and my mom wasn‚Äôt feeling well, a theme of the trip. After a brief rest, my husband and I ventured to the station for Hiroshima-yaki and extensive station mall shopping. There is so much carp merchandise in Hiroshima, you guys. I feel lied to that I haven‚Äôt seen anyone mention this before. **Thursday 7/17 - Hiroshima to Miyajima** This was our hotel transfer to Miyajima day. Our ryokan (Hotel Grand Miyajima Arimoto) sent us an english email that morning asking for any allergies and letting us know that we needed to arrive no later than 6 pm if we wanted dinner. We wanted dinner. So we kept the morning light, going to the Craft History Museum (light on english but very visual), super donki, hama sushi, and for a bit of karaoke before hopping on the JR ferry to Miyajimaguchi. It was drizzling when we arrived on Miyajima, and it basically rained the whole time we were on the island. But it was still beautiful. I don‚Äôt think I expected to like Miyajima as much as I did. It really isn‚Äôt overhyped. Our ryokan was a short walk from Itsukushima Shrine, with the tide times displayed on a chart next to the elevators. They also offered evening and morning tours of the area, Japanese language only. We tried the night tour, and even I barely understood anything, on top of the rain switching to pouring. But my husband braved the beach at night to get low tide shots of the gate. Our room was very nice, and dinner was also amazing. I love you ryokan sukiyaki. Never change. This ryokan has a lot of staff who speak english, but someone clearly clocked that we didn‚Äôt need that level of support, because the hostess they assigned to our meal services confessed to speaking very little, and I ended up doing a lot of interpreting for her and my mom so that they could communicate somewhat naturally. It‚Äôs clear the hotels on Miyajima expect a lot of foreign visitors, but it‚Äôs also clear that having some language ability is really appreciated. The one weakness of this ryokan was the onsen. There was one bigger bathing room, and one smaller one, which rotated between men and women in the morning. Neither had a view to speak of, and the set up was fairly basic. But they allowed covered tattoos in the public onsen so that‚Äôs a win, as my mom has several. **Friday 7/18 - Miyajima to Matsuyama** After ryokan breakfast, my mom and husband decided to take morning onsen dips while I jogged over to Itsukushima to catch the gate at low tide. Because it was on the early side for ferries to come in, there weren‚Äôt that many people there, and I was able to take as many pictures as I wanted (there are more pictures of this on my phone than of the rest of the trip hahaha). A Japanese woman even offered to take my picture with the gate. It‚Äôs absolutely massive in person, and I‚Äôm glad I did it. Plus at low tide you can see all of the little crabs on the beach. Even after the tide came in a bit, we still saw people wading out to get a picture with the gate, so I‚Äôm glad I went when I did. We checked out of the ryokan but left our stuff, and started the morning officially with a walk over to Daishoin. We actually learned about this temple from Zatsu Tabi! It has a couple of unique features. The stairs leading up to the temple have spinning sutras by the hand rail, with the idea being that you spin them as you walk up and it ‚Äúcounts‚Äù as saying them. There‚Äôs also a sort of cave in the back with altars representing all of the temples from the Henro pilgrimage, so that you can essentially speedrun the Henro. As someone who‚Äôs been to a lot of temples, these things were both new to me. After that, we went into Itsukushima proper. (We waited a little because I‚Äôd seen a large school group go in during my dash to the gate.) it was still basically low tide, so all of the structures were visible. I feel like wood rot must be a huge upkeep issue with this shrine. But it‚Äôs very beautiful, and the crowds were manageable, especially since we weren‚Äôt there to worship. After that we walked along the shopping street. The deep fried momiji manju were great, they taste a bit like funnel cake. Lunch was eel, one of the local specialties. We‚Äôre not a fan of oysters so figured we might as well do the other one. We bought a lot of souvenirs, and I got my Sugi Bee member‚Äôs card stamped at the Miyajima branch. And a deer tried to steal my second deep fried momiji manju. Lesson learned, don‚Äôt take them out of the shopping street. With shopping complete, we got our bags, shuttled back to the port, and took two boats to get to Matsuyama, our next destination. And that's it for part 1. See you in part 2!"}

On our first night after we arrived, we went to a yakitori place under an archway in Yurakucho which was amazing and a great way to start the trip. \\- **Day 1** We walked around Kagurazaka (we were there in the morning and there wasn‚Äôt much going on, seems like it would be better to visit at night as we saw lots of nice looking restaurants), Akihabara, Asakusa (did not like Asakusa as it was pure over-tourism, so if your time is short in Tokyo and you are visiting other temples during your trip, I personally would skip). This evening, we walked around Shinjuku, went to Omoide Yokocho (I recommend avoiding this place, as it was mentally busy and not very enjoyable to walk around) then to Golden Gai. Golden Gai was really cool. All the staff in the different bars we went to were really nice and friendly. I recommend having one drink in a few different places as the bars are all different with different vibes. We finished our night with amazing ramen in Golden Gai. \\- **Day 2** We went to Teamlabs Planets. We enjoyed it, but if you have limited time in Tokyo I don‚Äôt think it is a good way to spend half a day because it isn‚Äôt a particularly Japanese experience in my opinion. There was a blue bottle caf√© by a park nearby which was a nice place to people watch afterwards. We then got a bus to Tsukiji for some food and went to a great place for tuna Kaisendon, though it kind of gave us the raw fish ick, because it was such a big portion of raw fish, which took a week to lift which was unfortunate. That night we went for food in Koenji which seemed like a cool area but we were too jetlagged to make the most of the bars. \\- **Day 3** We walked around Sangenjaya, which was nice and interesting to explore. We then got a bus to Shimokitazawa which was really cool. The vintage shops are amazing and fun to explore if thats your thing. We then went to Nakameguro, then Daikanyamacho, then Harijuku. We honestly hated Harijuku and I don‚Äôt think it is worth visiting unless you enjoy queuing with other tourists to buy gross things specifically for tourists... We skipped a hotel refresh and went straight to Shibuya to go to Shibuya sky. This was a wild amount of walking this day and it was cold. We didn‚Äôt want to miss any of these neighbourhoods but it was perhaps excessive visiting all in one day. I would say definitely to go to Shimokitazawa and the other neighbours just depending how much time you have / what season it is e.g. Nakameguro looks stunning during cherry blossom season. Even though it is obviously touristy, I enjoyed Shibuya Sky. It's amazing to see a 360 sky line - try and go at sunset. **Onomichi - 2 nights** We really liked Onomichi. It was a nice change of pace from Tokyo and nice to be by the sea. We stayed in a really nice hostel Lemonsea Onomichi. We had a private room and although it is a hostel, it was nicer then some of our much more expensive accommodation. When we arrived from Tokyo, we dumped our bags and explored. The next morning, we got up early, spent the morning walking the ‚Äòtemple trail‚Äô and visited a lovely tea house. We then jumped on the train to Hiroshima for the afternoon. We did this because we didn‚Äôt want to stay more nights in a big city and felt it was wrong to miss going to Hiroshima ‚Äì we felt like it was important to go and almost pay respect / to acknowledge the tragedy that took place there and were glad we went even though it was fairly out of the way. **Osaka ‚Äì 2 nights** We loved Osaka and wished we had longer there. While we were there, we wandered around: Dontonbori, Shinsekai, Namba, Nipponbashi and Nakazakicho (a hipstery area which was great for a matcha fix). Our main focus in Osaka was eating and drinking. We had a big night out the first night in the Dontonbori area, went to a few cocktail bars, then hired a private karaoke room with an unlimited drinks package lol. It was fun. Would recommend even if Kareoke isnt your thing. On the second night, we went to Tenma which was a really cool area filled with loads of casual restaurants. It was v cool to walk around and people watch. We then went to the Ekimae building which was also v cool. It is quite a surreal place - hundreds of tiny restaurants in a kind of weird old building. It was absolutely packed with office workers. **Kyoto ‚Äì 3 nights** In Kyoto we did the standard tourist hit list. We didn‚Äôt love Kyoto. While it is obviously a beautiful place, for us the hoards and hoards of tourists unfortunately spoil the experience and we felt guilty contributing to the over-tourism. Getting the bus about places takes ages because the traffic is bad and there are so many people getting on and off the buses. We were still glad we went, and did still enjoy walking around the quieter streets exploring, but visiting the temples and all the ‚Äòmust visit spots‚Äô was pretty stressful. I can‚Äôt imagine what it would be like in peak season. We had one nice day visiting a park and temple that were further out. Would really recommend seeking out temples/parks that are less busy. Do think it is worth going to Fushimi Inari super early like most people recommend so you are not walking to the top in a queue. Pontocho seemed quite touristy compared to places we had been in Osaka and Tokyo. Defo not a must visit in my opinion. **Kanazawa ‚Äì 2 nights** We really liked Kanazawa. We were unlucky with the weather as it was v cold and wet but would recommend visiting. If you don‚Äôt like crowds, I think could be a good idea to skip Kyoto and go to Kanazawa instead especially in the peak season. We wandered around the Samurai District, the Old Town and visited the gardens which were nice (though would be much nicer in the other seasons when there are plants in bloom). The fish market in Kanazawa was great. We ended up having snow crab and beer one morning (I inadvertently ordered a $50 crab‚Ä¶) but it was a cool experience and delicious. There were lots of locals all doing the same and they were offering us different things to try. **Okuhida ‚Äì 2 nights** The scenery was amazing on the bus from Kanazawa to Okuhida. We stayed in two different onsen hotels in different villages ‚Äì one more modern and one more traditional. We loved the hotels but we were unrealistic about how easy it would be to get to the villages and get between them. The distance was not far (10 mins drive between them) but there were no taxis so it was a bit of a faff and waste of time waiting for multiple buses, as there was also no direct route. We had planned to go to the Okuhida Shinhotaka Ropeway but it was going to be too logistically difficult with moving hotels plus the generally limited public transport. So this was a mistake in planning. Also personally I think 1 night in an onsen hotel is enough. The large breakfasts and Kaiseki meals at night were amazing, but a bit much two days in a row. There are also only so many onsens you can have before you skin starts suffering. Okuhida was lovely, with stunning scenery and we were glad we went, especially being in Japan in the winter and getting to see all the snowy mountains. I think 1 night would have been plenty with perhaps an extra night in Kanazawa, or in Takayama (which we drove through and thought looked really beautiful). **Kiso Valley ‚Äì 2/3 nights** We made our way via bus and train from Okuhida to Nagiso via Matsumoto. It was a long day of travelling but doable. The train to Nagiso from Matsumoto was amazing - the scenery was stunning. We stayed the first night in Nagiso in Hostel Yui-an which was really lovely and with nice owners. The next morning, we were up early and spent a couple hours walking in the Atera Valley which was beautiful. We then made our way to Magome where we stayed in a guest house. We were glad we stayed here as it meant we got to wander at night and in the morning before the day trippers arrived. We walked the next day from Magome to Tsumago, then got the bus back. We did the walk much faster than we thought we would and had started really early. We therefore got back to our guest house earlier and decided to leave a night earlier so we could get an extra night in Tokyo before going home. Tsumago and Magome are really lovely, but there are a lot of tourists. The walk wasn‚Äôt busy though which was good. I would say if you are tight for time, if you plan properly with train and bus times, 2 nights is enough in Kiso Valley to do some walking (if you are reasonably fit) and see a couple of the postal towns. We then had a night in Nagoya, before going back to Tokyo for two more nights. We stayed in Shinbashi the second time we were in Tokyo and thought it was a great place to be based. There are loads of amazing food options, e.g. loads of really cool tiny restaurants and bars of all kinds in and around Shimbashi station. Some were a bit intimidating but when you did get a seat somewhere you felt like you had won a prize. **General thoughts / advice** \\- The biggest recommendation I have is to use Tabelog to find your restaurants. You can search by area, rating and by type of food and find amazing places everywhere you go this way. It was really interesting comparing google reviews of places to Tabelog reviews... Some of the Japanese reviews on Tabelog were hilarious ‚Äì they are very discerning. I read that anything over 3.5 means a restaurant is great on Tabelog. Using it for the whole trip meant we literally did not have a bad meal and managed to try everything we wanted. It also means you don‚Äôt need to stress too much about basing your plans for the day/night around where you are going to eat because with Tabelog you can get loads of options for wherever you will be. \\- Definitely use the luggage forwarding service and avoid bringing big cases to more rural remote places. It was v embarrassing trying to cart about huge cases in Kiso Valley and the local buses did not really have space for them so that was a big mistake. It was also pretty mortifying showing up to our wooden guesthouse in Magome and our cases wouldn‚Äôt fit up the stairs to our room and then had to sit in the communal hallway. We packed way too many clothes as we thought it would be too much faff doing a washing half way through our trip but this was the wrong call. Pack lighter and get washing done! \\- We moved around a lot and it wasn‚Äôt a very relaxing holiday. Our average daily step count was wild. However, it is difficult if you don‚Äôt know if you will be back to Japan to be selective and miss places out when you already feel like you are barely scratching the surface with just 3 weeks. However, if you don't have huge amounts of energy / want a semi relaxing holiday, don't do as much moving around as we did within this timeframe. \\- While public transport is obviously generally great, if we were to go back to Japan, we would maybe hire a car if traveling to rural areas to have more flexibility and freedom. The roads seemed pretty calm and they drive on the left side (we are from the UK). \\- We learned the (very) basics language wise that you would learn anywhere you go. We found it hard and a little awkward but we felt it was really appreciated. It definitely helped going to restaurants to be able to ask for a table in Japanese. \\- This is not a Japan specific tip but I pinned loads of coffee shops on Google maps that I thought looked good in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto before we went so I could always check when we were out and about where there was one close by which was handy."}

I went with three friends, and we all climbed to the summit together. We paid the entrance fee for Mt Fuji online and received QR codes. We booked a hut at the 8th station Taishikan and we were going to take the Yoshida route. None of us were hikers or had any experience hiking, but felt that we were relatively fit. I personally barely do any exercise but my job requires me to walk around for at least 5 hours a day without sitting down so I wasn't sedentary or anything. That being said, none of us hiked, so we rented equipment from Yamarent. The beginner's 6 piece set. **July 21st** We woke up at roughly 5:30am, left at 7am and headed to the Yamarent store in Shinjuku. The sizes that we initially ordered were too small for us though, so it took some time to try on new hiking boots and such. Afterwards we rushed to Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal to catch our bus to the Fuji Subaru Line 5th station. Right outside of the bus stop there was a Lawson though, so we loaded up on lots of onigiris and boarded our bus at 8am. The ride took roughly 3 hours and we got there at 11am. Once we arrived we hung about for 30 minutes. We knew that acclimating to the altitude was important and its recommended to hang around for an hour or so, but our check-in time for the hut was between 2pm-5pm so we had to start moving soon. Around the 5th station there's some ads posted around with a QR code that makes you install a Mt Fuji climbing app. It was actually a very helpful app that showed us where we were on the trail and updated us on the time and altitude. To bring back that point about the heat earlier, when we arrived to the 5th station we immediately felt a lot cooler there. It was around 32-34 degrees in Shinjuku but it felt like 28 around the 5th station if I had to estimate. However, the clouds were on and off, covering the sun up. Once the sun started beaming down again, it felt like we were being baked. Sunscreen was super important here. Also, there were signs plastered everywhere saying that bins do not exist on Mt Fuji and all trash must be carried back home with you. This issue will come up again later. Anyway, at 11:30am, we started our hike. Before heading to the Yoshida trail, there's a counter where you show them the QR codes you received if you paid the entrance fee online. We received glow in the dark tags that we were required to put somewhere visible on our bodies or backpacks. Once we did that, there were guards at the entrance to Mt Fuji that checked whether your tag was correctly placed, before letting you go on the climb. The climb itself was pretty strenuous for us. At the start of the hike it's pretty simple though, a gravel path with a slight incline where you're pretty much just walking. The views around here are already pretty great though, overlooking forests and lakes, clouds around us. We even saw a deer and her baby roaming around. And even though I had been worried about hiking in summer, the heat wasn't a problem at all, just when it started baking us as the clouds parted momentarily. However, around the 7th station the difficulty ramps up a lot. The easy to walk path doesn't exist anymore, and there's just natural rock formation that you have to take big steps over, or start using your hands or hiking sticks to climb. It can be very easy to fall if you misstep or have bad footing so had to be super careful. Yamarent's hiking boots were super good though, I was stepping onto rock surfaces that I had no right gripping on to. Also, I'm not sure if the hike brought out some breathing issues I was unaware of, but I found myself huffing and puffing really fast, even though I wasn't actually tired. After many 5 minute breaks and our onigiri stockpile finished, we made it to our 8th station hut at 4:20pm. We were served dinner at around 6pm, it was some grilled mackarel, curry and rice, a small salad and a red bean fish cake for dessert. It was a small meal but somehow pretty filling. Stepping out of the hut to go to the bathroom, it was surreal being surrounded by nothing but clouds After we ate, we went straight to bed. We had initially planned to wake up at 12:30am to start hiking again to catch the sunrise, but we overheard plans from other hikers in the hut that planned to leave at 11:30pm instead, so we decided to follow along. **July 22nd (almost)** I only got about 3 hours of sleep. The Taishikan Hut was extremely hospitable, the staff were extremely nice and the food was great, but the sleeping quarters unfortunately were rough around the edges. We didn't expect luxury at all, we were just happy to be sleeping somewhere at all, but the leather block pillow and mattress was tough to sleep on. And it was like a capsule hotel, so there were neighbours right next to each capsule. Unfortunately there was a really inconsiderate couple talking throughout the night that stopped my sleep, and I lost my temper and yelled at them to be quiet after which they did. But at 11:30pm, we got up, got ready and headed off again. The stretch from the 8th station to the 9th station was also rough, in that the stretch from the 7th station to the 8th station was a painful 2 hours, but this was going to be double the length. But in terms of the incline, it felt about the same. Climbing at 12am, the stars looked incredible and we could see shooting stars from time to time. Leaving the hut at 11:30pm was actually good, because nearing the summit there's a lot of traffic. We reached the summit at 4:18am, just in time to see the sun rise at 4:35am. We hung out there for about an hour and a half enjoying the corn soup from the vending machines and admiring the view. Once we had our fill, we began the descent at 6am. The descent was so much worse than the ascent for our group. The entire descent down was the gravel pavement from the earlier 5th station to 6th station stretch, but the gravel was finer and the steep declines would have your feet sliding. Feet being raked across the gravel, all of us were in pain for the next 5 hours. Eventually we made it back to the 5th station at around 12:30pm. Apparently it takes 5 hours on average, but our feet were in so much pain we took a lot of breaks just to let our feet rest. By the end of the hike we had 4 bags packed to the brim with garbage (empty water bottles). During the ascent we bought a lot of water bottles at the various huts lined along the Yoshida Trail beause we hadn't packed any water beforehand, so we had lots of garbage that just kept piling up as we were hiking and couldn't dispose of it because of no bins on Mt Fuji. Bring a lot of cash because the huts will milk you dry if you're not packing a lot of water. Overall, it was a pretty great experience as a group of people that haven't hiked at all. The views along the path were stunning, and the weather really worked out in our favour as the hike wasn't rainy at all and it wasn't windy at all either. Though it was funny, an hour after we got back down to the 5th station it started thunderstorming and hailing. We met some pretty interesting people along the way (a group of girls that we kept running into along each station, a Spanish father yelling obscenities whenever he checked how many meters were left till the hike was finally over, a man who hiked to the top in a white tuxedo and dress shoes??) and the whole thing was an experience I won't forget. The vibes are great too, everyone being friendly and having that understanding that we're all going through a struggle together to reach the top. I'd do it again for sure, maybe another trail, but hearing how the Yoshida Trail is the easiest one, we'd probably have to become more fit before we can take on the others."}

He loves being in the car and he is a pretty chill kid. We don‚Äôt do much screen time at home, so it was not as engaging for him when we needed to keep him quiet in restaurants, but sticker books were a big hit for us. For the flight (11h+4h) we booked seats at the front to have more space, and both flights were night ones so our son slept a lot and was happy to play with cars at our feet or do sticker books. Is it comfortable to be on a plane for that long? No. Is it worse with a 13kg toddler on you? Maybe. But I was not willing to pay for an extra seat when I didn‚Äôt have to. For the Bullet Train, we booked the seats with the luggage space and it was perfect for putting the stroller (our son was parked there sleeping for part of the journey). On public transportation, we didn‚Äôt feel that it was that quiet, not more than in London, so don‚Äôt stress too much about your kids being a normally noisy one. (I‚Äôm not talking about screaming here, just the classic noise level a child makes.) Yes, lunches were more pleasant when our son was napping, and it was a bit stressful to have lunch and dinner in restaurants, but we were still able to eat in small places run by grandmas. We have done one ‚Äúfamily restaurant‚Äù and four sushi conveyor belt ones, and the rest were all small local restaurants. People were always very accommodating and understanding (toddlers are messy eaters so a lot of ‚ÄúSumimasen‚Äù was said). Most restaurants had kid cutlery/plates and often highchairs. Our son, who was not into food that much at the time, really enjoyed soba noodles and fried chicken. We would buy fruit and snacks from Konbini. We tried to find local playgrounds for him to have ‚Äúkid-friendly‚Äù time and it was very nice to interact with local families. Our travel was mostly wandering around temples, gardens, and towns, and our son doesn‚Äôt mind being in his pram (ours was a Yoyo, so light and easy for travel), and he was in the carrier for the short nature walks we did. It was easy in the smaller cities to let him run around as a lot of the areas we visited were quiet with not much car traffic. So many interactions with people happened thanks to our son; everyone was adorable to him and he often received small gifts (an old man in the bus in Kyoto gave him his penguin purse ‚Ä¶so cute). It is more work to travel with children as you still have to parent, but there are so many more smiles and magical moments that I never regretted taking him with us. My toddler was still breastfeeding at the time (and a lot as it was very hot) and I would cover us with a big towel/muslin cloth when he asked for it. I had 1 bad look in a shop. I think it was the maximum I could do as I was not going to go to the toilets to feed my son, and personally we saw 3 nursery rooms over our trip all in malls. Diapers were found in big supermarkets and changing facilities were available in 80% of the toilets (in both genders!!!). Our toddler nap on the go in the pram or in the car. We tried to planned activity around his midday nap and it worked out very well. I think the heat help to make his pram nap happened. Did he nap 2h like at home, no. Was it enough for him to not be cranky and enjoy the rest of the day, yes :). **Budget** Total for 3 weeks: **8000 euros** * Flight : 2340 euros * Hotels: 2240 euros * Car rental: 375 euros * Other: 3045 euros For Others cost below is a rough estimation as I can‚Äôt know more details from the suica and cash * transports (bullet trains, metro, taxis): 500 euros * Activities (museum, cruises, cycling, temples): 300 euros * Shopping: 200 euros * Food (restaurant, snacks) : 2045 Euros **Weather** The rainy season was quite dry as we had maybe 5 hours of rain over 3 weeks and it was over 2 or 3 days. The rain was at the perfect time, making the Edo villages we visited even more beautiful. Kyoto and Tokyo were sunny, so very hot (35¬∞C - real feel even higher) and we managed by having wet muslin cloths around our neck and over the pram when toddler was napping, plus a small fan and a lot of drinking. I got very scared from this forum about the weather conditions but in the end there was AC or fans everywhere and we didn‚Äôt struggle that much with it. Yes, it is hot but not hell on earth (yes, it was not really summer yet‚Ä¶ but still). **Other tips** I have a lot of tattoos and most hotels advertising a no tattoos policy online were all happy to let me use their public bath (they were always empty anyway) If you have an iPhone use the Suica app as a payment card, the rate were better than using our credit card. Most restaurants we did were cash only so we also did a lot of withdraw in Konbini ATM. We never buy souvenirs on holidays but Japan makes you want to buy a lot of things as there are shops everywhere even in temples. We did a fair amount of clothes, decor and ceramics shopping. The best were the recycling center/thrift stores in the suburbs. So if you are like me and rolled your eyes at all the posts about additional suitcases for souvenirs maybe reassess your judgement and take an empty bag as we had to buy a suitcase there (go to thrift stores if you need one) **Travel details** We spent the first night and a big morning in **Nara** so we just walked around the park with the deers and it was a lovely first Japan experience. It was a bit of a journey from Osaka airport but not terrible. In the afternoon we took a train to **Kyoto**. This sub and the whole internet scared me a bit too much about **Kyoto** overtourism so I hadn‚Äôt planned many days there and not the main tourist spots. We were staying in Gion which was great, to see a touristy area quiet in the evening, and with the jet lag we were able to wander at night at Yasaka Shrine which was magical: lanterns are lit and it‚Äôs totally empty. I did a lot of research to find temples and gardens matching our interests and we had a great time. We didn‚Äôt see many tourists in our 3 days in Kyoto and the places we visited were stunning. Top temples: Otagi Nenbutsuji Temple, Daikaku-ji Temple, and Tenjuan Zen Garden. I regret not having more days there. **The Japanese Alps road trip** was our favorite part of the holiday. Being able to drive around was amazing, the landscapes and scenery are beautiful and it makes it so easy to chuck everything in the car and travel to the next destination. Japanese people don‚Äôt respect the speed limits at all but other than that my British husband found it easy to drive around (directions are in Latin letters on the road signs). **Nagano** was a very nice city to visit with a beautiful museum, great kid playground, and the temple was beautiful. **Matsumoto** museum had the best immersive exhibition of the local artist Yayoi Kusama (the dot lady). We haven‚Äôt visited the castle for lack of time (a toddler gives more time restrictions and you have to accept missing some things sometimes) but we loved the small streets of the center. **Magome‚ÄìTsumago** Post Town Trail was a great part of the trip. These Edo villages were beautiful and exactly what I wanted to see in Japan, and they are set in splendid mountain and forest scenery. We did a lot of waterfall walks and we were mostly alone for all this part of the trip. **Magome** is more touristic but still very enjoyable, and as people come here to hike they are mostly lovely tourists :D We met wonderful people on the trail. The trail itself was 3-4 hours and a pretty easy walk, mainly in the forest. We stayed in 2 different guesthouses and it was a very nice experience for both. **Takayama** was a lovely old town and a great place to wander around. We did a day out in **Hida-Furukawa** village with its lovely carp koi-filled canals. Something fun to do around there was Gatan Go, a bike tour on an old train track, then we did another waterfall walk. We then drove to **Kanazawa** passing through **Shirakawa-go**, a must-see UNESCO-listed farm village. Very touristic but well organised and still full of charm, but I will recommend to also do the other villages in the area. We really loved the second village, **Suganuma Gassho-zukuri**, smaller and less crowded. **Kanazawa** had a nice garden to stroll around and a nice fish market. We had the best sushi of our trip in the conveyor belt restaurant - Morimori Sushi. There are also small historical streets to wander around but for us, 1 day was plenty of time to enjoy the city as it was already a bit too big for our taste. We drove back to **Nagano** and stopped on a beach where there were people looking for jade pebbles. We had a swim as it didn‚Äôt seem forbidden and headed to the onsen town where we stay in the old ryokan Kanaguya (looks like Spirited Away bathhouse). It was nice to be able to enjoy a private bath as a family, and the building is beautiful but quite ‚Äúdated‚Äù for the price and the food was not great. It is next to the monkey park which we visited the next morning‚Äîgreat walk in the forest leading to the monkey platform. It‚Äôs nice if you love monkeys and our toddler loved it. We then took the train to **Tokyo**. We didn‚Äôt enjoy **Tokyo**. We stayed in Asakusa for 3 nights and 2 nights in Akasaka. We did both TeamLab and 1 Studio Ghibli 3D Sculpture Exhibition, and a river cruise great activities with a kid, and we tried to wander around Asakusa, Ginza, Tennozu Isle, Toyosu, Nakano, but mostly failed to enjoy it as it was mostly shopping centers and too big to walk. Asakusa was the nicest area as it was more residential and walkable, the rest was just a no-charm experience. On our last day we really enjoyed the Oedo Antique Market, great selection of decor and kimono (tip: 2nd-hand kimono are dirt cheap, around 1000 yen). Hope this help someone and dont hesitate to contact me for more details."}

Previously I did the classic Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka loop in a group. - This was a fairly fast paced trip, sometimes with two cities scheduled in a day - In general, I browse things pretty quickly. As in I might look at something, maybe take a picture, then move on ## Dates: ### Oct 27 (Tokyo) - ARRIVAL - Asakusa Since I arrived in the afternoon, I visited Asakusa since I was staying nearby. It's undeniably pretty but crowded, and honestly, I don't think temples are Tokyo's strong point. Still, worth a quick stop if you're in the area. After a bit of wandering, I called it a night. ### Oct 28 (Toyama + Kanazawa) - Toyama Glass Art Museum - Toyama City Hall Observation Tower - Kanazawa Castle - Kenroku-en Garden - Higashi Chaya District I had originally planned to do the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route, but rain was forecasted, so I cancelled it last minute and went direct to Toyama instead. It was quite pleasent. The Glass Art Museum was really pretty, and the observation tower had surprisingly nice views despite the weather. Definitely a city I‚Äôd want to explore more. Because my day was suddenly expedited by losing the Kurobe Alpine route, I had time to go to Kanazawa early. Kanazawa Castle was decent, and I enjoyed Kenroku-en Garden a lot. In fact, it inspired me to visit several more gardens throughout this trip. Higashi Chaya was interesting, but I probably should have looked more into it before coming, since a lot of the tea-shops closed by 5pm or 6pm. Overall, Kanazawa was an ok experience for me, and I'm not planning a return trip anytime soon. ### Oct 29 (Osaka) - Kaiyukan Aquarium - Dotonbori / Shinsaibashi / Umeda I didn't have too much planned for this day (since my schedule was pushed up). Kaiyukan Aquarium was a great experience and I would highly recommend. Aside from that, I mostly spent the day wandering Osaka, as I didn't really have the chance to last time I visited. Overall, Osaka is a great city and I enjoyed wandering around. ### Oct 30 (Nara + Osaka) - Nara Park - Isuien Garden - Yoshikien Garden - Osaka Castle - Den-Den Town Probably my favourite day on this trip. I **really** enjoyed Nara park, not just for the deer but also all the temples around, 10/10 recommend. Because of Kanzawaw, I also visited multiple gardens which were unplanned. Afterwards, I also travelled back to Osaka to see Osaka Castle as well as check out DenDen Town. Both were quite pleasent and I'd recommend check them out. ### Oct 31 (Yokohama + Tokyo) - Yokohama Chinatown - Hara Model Railway Museum - Odaiba - Miraikan - \"Halloween\" **The single biggest regret** on the trip was coming back to Tokyo this early. I think I severly overestimated the experience of being in Tokyo for Halloween, which was quite dissapointing. However, the real issue was that I did not have nearly enough things planned to do in Tokyo. After all, I mentioned in the context that I go through things fairly quickly. My reasoning was that its Tokyo, I can definitely find things to do to spend time. Yeah, I did not. Sure, there are things to do, but I believe that many of them are primarily enjoyable with friends, such as Tokyo DisneySea. I would have definitly chose to spend more time in the Kansai region, and would have rather visited Kobe, Kyoto, and/or Nagoya. Anyways, the actual activites on this day were pretty decent. I took a nightbus from Osaka -&gt; Shinjuku and arrived at around 8am. Yokohama Chinatown was really enjoyable to visit, as was the Hara Model Railway Museum. Miraikan was interesting, but I think that the experience was slightly hampered by how there was an elementary school visiting. I have nothing against kids, but they did take up most of the time with the exhibits. Onto the evening, and Halloween was a bit of a *shitshow*. They **UNCROSSED SHIBUYA CROSSING** as well as blocked off some passageways and station entrances, leading to an extremely painful time getting around. Also there were banners everywhere which had \"NO EVENTS\" printed on them. There were some costumes, but not as much as you'd might imagine. 0/10 Halloween exprience. It seems like the right play would've been to go visit some bar/club, but personally those don't really appeal to me, and I dont think they would be fun without friends. ### Nov 1 (Tokyo) - Ginza - Ikebukuro - Sunshine 60 Observatory This was mostly a shopping day for me. The only notable place was the Sunshine 60 observatory in Ikebukuro. You should probably consider the weather before visiting, because it was cloudy when I went so I couldn't see anything outside the windows. The clouds did make for some really cool photos however, as they essentially acted as a backlight. ### Nov 2 (Tokyo) - Rikugien Garden - ??? Yeah this is where I ran out of ideas to do for Tokyo. I visited Rikugien Garden, but aside from that I was basically just wandering around. I don't remember what I did except for spending some time in Akihabara. Overall I severely underplanned Tokyo and should have looked into it more. ### Nov 3 (Tokyo) - DEPARTURE - Mt Takao Surprisingly my second favourite day of the trip. I found out about this the night before, and decided to give it a try. Climbing Mt Takao was a really great experience for me, and definitly another 10/10 recommend. I wanted to visit Meiji Jingu, but discovered too late that they closed after sundown. Also, I know that it's good practice to arrive at least 3h before a flight, but I got to the departure gate literally like 10 min after arriving at Haneda. ## Tools Comments: - **Navigation:** Google Maps - **Planning:** Wanderlog. Honestly I didn't really use many of Wanderlogs' features aside from just an easy map of where everything is. I did most of the scheduling on the fly. - **Translation:** Google Translate - **Wifi:** Airalo - **Other Nice to Have Items:** earbuds, power bank, umbrella, fanny pack. ## Other Comments: - I was actually strapped on cash a bit, partially because I had to buy a Shinkansen ticket to Toyama since I wasn't doing the Alpine route anymore. For context, I brought 100,000 yen with me, but I also didn't prebook anything except for the hotels. Thankfully I realized the fact before I ran out of cash, since while most things can be paid for with credit card, IC refills cannot. I think I spent an addtional ~300 CAD via credit card. - I tried to pack pretty light, and only brough a backpack and fanny pack with me. But I still think I overpacked, especially on the exterior clothes. I brough like 3 sweaters with me, which in fairness was because I was expecting to go on the Alpine route, but I ended up only using 1/3 of them. I did use the landury once midway. - Daylight was a serious consideration for this trip. I had to make sure that I got to the outdoor activities before it became dark. Also because of this, I tended to wake up and sleep early (8am - 11pm). - In a similar vein, the weather wasn't always the greatest on this trip. When I first arrived, it was actually forecasted to rain every single day of this trip. Luckily, it only ended up raining for 2/7 days. - Flight tickets for this trip were relatively cheap. I spent ~1100 CAD for a round trip ticket. For reference, during 2023 July (my first time visiting), it cost me ~2100 CAD. So this entire trip cost me barely more than just the flight ticket of my last trip. - I stayed in hostels througout my trip. My reasoning was that as long as the accomodations met basic requirements, it didn't matter much as I was spending the bulk of my time outside anyways. On average, it was ~30 CAD a night. - I didn't mention food in this report, but I think that pretty much everything I had was great. I didn't have any specific locations planned, and mostly went with flow in regards to food choice. - I think that I lean more towards the nature side of Japan versus the city side. Of course, I love the cities and am actually a transit enthusiast, but I think overall the most enjoyable / memoreable days have all been nature related (Nara, Takao). - Overall I enjoy the Kansai region more than Tokyo. Even for my first trip, Osaka was more memorable to me than Tokyo. If I were to take another trip, I would definitly want to spend more time there, as well as check out the Kyushu area. If I ever moved to Japan, it would also be in the Kansai region. Overall great trip with a few hiccups, and I would definitly visit a third time. Feel free to ask questions!"}

Sharing our experience to pass it forward, so someone else may find it helpful for their plans/ideas. **Context:** * Two teenagers who have never been to Japan. They want to see some of the sites posted on social media. Two parents who have been to Japan before and want to avoid crazy tourist spots. * Minimize backtracking as much as possible. * Index towards public transportation. No car rental. **11 day/10 Night Itinerary:** * Narita (1 night) * Overnight at hotel near airport, with early morning flight out to Hiroshima. Its cheaper and faster than taking shinkansen. * The optimal food option (cost, variety, quality, and effort) is to eat at Narita airport. Terminal 3 has a pretty good food court before security. * Hiroshima (2 nights) * Peace Park and Museum: Solemn experience, worth it. * Miyajima: Floating Tori Gate and Mt. Misen. The ropeway up to Mt. Misen was closed due to maintenance, thus we hiked up. There is no water up on top except for two vending machines. Plan accordingly. * Shotengai: Are shopping street/arcades typically with a covered roof. Can find one in most Japanese cities has numerous dining and shopping options. Hiroshima Hondori shotengai has lots of shopping and dining options. * Kotohira (1 night) * Ritsurin Garden in Takamatsu: Visited in the morning, few visitors, amazing Japanese Garden. * Kotohira Shrine (Konpira-san/Kotohiragu): This was a hidden gem, visited near closing and early in the morning. Very tranquil, not many tourists, there are many steps to climb. * There are numerous good rykoans with onsen and kaiseki here. * Himeji (1 night) * Himeji Castle: Very impressive castle and grounds, you also get a small discount if you have any of the major JR rail pass. * Himeji shotengai, between station and castle. Seems to closed down earlier than other shotengai. Maybe caters more to the tourist vising for the day. * Kyoto (3 nights) * Kobe: Day trip going from Himeji to Kyoto. Visited Nunobiki Herb Garden just right next to the station. Enjoyable, nothing too amazing. Took the ropeway up, hiked down. Thought the hike down was more enjoyable, i.e. waterfalls, quietness, nature. * Osaka: We bypassed it except for a night trip to visit Dotonbori. * Almost every sightseeing place we went to in the Kyoto/Osaka/Nara area were heavily packed with tourists. Tour buses were ubiquitous here. Early morning is best bet to avoid crowd, but there will still be tourists like us. * Tokyo (2 nights) * Ueno Station: Based near here due to plan to ride Keishi Skyliner back to airport. * Teamlab Borderless: Great experience. More enjoyable if take time to slow down and immerse/interact with the exhibit. * By this point, the teens were scarred from the heavy touristy spots in Kyoto/Osaka, so changed plan to avoid super crowded areas and focused on shopping and enjoying the food. **Transportation Passes:** * **Kansai Hiroshima Area Pass:** The transportation cost between Hiroshima and Kyoto was comparable with or without the pass. However, the flexibility that the pass provided was what worked for us as we could hop on any JR train (including shinkansen) without spending time booking individual tickets. This saved a lot of time. * **Tokyo Metro 24, 48 or 72H Pass:** As others have mentioned this was not a slam dunk decision. It only works on Tokyo Metro and Toei subway lines. Not on JR trains or buses. We got it and worked for us as we were based near Ueno station which has two metro lines there. It let us hit shopping areas away from the more touristy places. It required transferring multiple lines, but gave flexibility on when to make the transfer. * **Google Map:** Is a very useful app, but doesn't filter by what pass you have and you'll need to know pass limitation outside of the app. We tried other apps and none were as good as Google Map with routing and on time info. * Kyoto &lt;&gt; Nara is serviced by two rail companies (JR and Kintetsu). JR rail pass only works on JR and not Kintetus. Google Maps would route us on both companies in a single trip. * Tokyo Metro and Toei subway lines are designated by a single letter, such as G = Ginza line, while JR lines are designated by two letters, such as JY = Yamanote line. Found setting Google Map filter (Options &gt; Prefer = Subway) helped a lot but would suggest JR lines even in that setting. **Heat and humidity is oppressive in the summer**: * After experiencing first day of heat, we adjusted our plan to sight see in the morning and travel/shop/veg in the afternoon with another possible sightseeing trip in the evening. We adjusted the itinerary to build in slack for rest due to heat. * Bring lots of quick dry clothes, not cotton. You are gonna sweat profusely. Can wash the quick dry overnight, wring it out with a towel and hang, should be dry by morning. However, I ended up doing it in the morning as the slightly damp clothes provided a nice cooling effect. * Pack Light: We forward our large luggage to Kyoto and packed what we needed for first segment of trip in our backpacks. To keep backpack light, we had two quick dry outfits each. Used luggage lockers to store backpacks when day tripping and don't have a hotel. Hope this travel report helps and happy traveling."}

I wanted to make a report/summary of our trip for both myself as a journey log and for reddit as a thank you to the community that has helped me so much. I hope this post can be helpful to other new travelers. So far, I have made a post to review my itinerary and a post of my revised itinerary. Now I will make a summary of the itinerary that was actually executed. **Context:** Was always a dream to visit Japan ever since discovering anime. Did a lot of research about the places we were going to visit and the activities we were going to do and even the restaurants we could eat in. Made a lot of backups incase things didn't go as planned (It didn't lol). Learned basic Japanese phrases through YouTube and ChatGPT (The goat 2nd only to Google Maps) that would help me communicate with locals when eating, commuting, shopping and sightseeing. **Apps That I Used:** **Google Maps** \\- My general primary travel guide. It was almost always on or in my background checking if we were on track and on time. **Google Lens** \\- Go-to translator/ information guide. Instant and relatively accurate. **ChatGPT** \\- My preferred translator when I wanted to ask questions on the fly. Preferred it because I was able to provide context and made the translations more appropriate. **Japan Transit Planner** \\- Used it whenever the trains got too confusing (mostly due to the local and rapid train schedules). Side note: Whenever I asked locals for directions on trains, they always used this app. **CardReader** \\- To keep track of our 5 suica cards **Ecbo Cloak** \\- Booked a reservation on our final day, so that we didn't have to drag our luggage around Tokyo. Highly recommend if you have large luggage. **NERV** \\- An alert app for natural disasters. Thankfully never had to use it **Accommodation:** We booked directly through a Japanese resident costing 11,600yen per night for a small 3-storey house complete with amenities in Kawasaki. Cheaper than a hotel booking especially for a family of 5 and imo more comfortable. Made our stay a lot more fun when we would buy bento and grocery food. The host was also sooo accommodating. **Things I learned:** **Be flexible.** The first few days I tried my hardest to stick to the itinerary and in turn quickly tired out my family. I could keep going, but I realized this was **our family** trip so I made retroactive changes. I also greatly overestimated my family's willingness to walk long distances. **Small Gripes** \\- As we were going in and out of Tokyo, it was baffling how the **left &amp; right walking etiquette kept changing**. I've noticed only Tokyo walks on the left and the further you are from Tokyo, right side walking becomes the norm. **Bus stops outside of Tokyo are very discreet.** A few were basically playing hide &amp; seek with us. **Lack of shade.** The fact that rain did not become a hindrance to our trip was both a blessing and a curse. The constant walking under the sun took a toll on my family. Changes had to be made due to this. This could be a tourist specific problem as everyone else would jump between being indoors and outdoors compared to us who would spend hours outside. The heat and humidity were fine like any SEA country, but it was the combination of long shadeless walks that became a problem. **Essentials: 1. Pocket Wifi** \\- Must-have for stress-free navigation. Ninja Wifi suited our needs the best. **2. IC card** \\- Must-have to avoid wasting time at ticket machines and getting stuck at ticket gates. Welcome Suicas are the best IMO as you can easily empty it out on your last train ride by choosing the option to top up the exact amount needed to exit the station. **3. Umbrella** \\- Or any other thing to protect you from the sun. **4. Power bank** \\- A small 10000 mAh one is enough to ensure your phone gets through the whole day. Your phone is your key to everything; don't lose access to it. **Summary: Amazing people.** I've read some people say that the Japanese do not like foreigners, but I still went in with an open mind and made sure I would be able to communicate with them on a basic level. I was equally met with kindness and sometimes even more as there were instances where they would personally lead us to where we needed to be. Staff were almost always kind except for one tourist trap place we ate at. **Amazing public transportation.** When you factor in the volume of daily commuters they need to cater, it's amazing how efficient the system is. Even in the Outer Tokyo parts, they manage to provide great service. There were times when the platforms, exits, train lines, local vs rapid trains got confusing, but it was manageable and I was getting more accustomed as time went on. **Amazing food.** Don't be scared to try anything. **Amazing culture.** If you respect the culture, I promise you it's very worth it. We weren't perfect ofcourse, but everyone was very understanding. Home Base #1: Okubo, Shinjuku **Day 1 (Start: 5PM) :** Early Dinner: Noseya (Abura Soba); Great first stop. Host/Chef was friendly and helpful. Lovely local soba restaurant. * Shinjuku - *Saw the cute 3D cat. Went to Alpen Tokyo to check out shoes and admire the baseball merch (All hail Ohtani-san)* * Shibuya - *Shibuya Crossing photo ops and Starbucks for an aerial view; Saw Hachiko the goat; Shibuya Loft to buy stampbooks* * PS: *We bought stampbooks for us to collect* *eki stamps* *of train stations we would pass through. A memorabilia I cannot recommend enough as it is a fun experience and something you can return to and reminisce on. We also bought a* *Goshuin book* *for the same reasons, but for shrines and temples. Instead of being free like in eki stamps, goshuins cost 500 yen but you get to watch beautiful calligraphy each time.* **Day 2** (**~~7AM~~** **7:30AM)** \\- Was also able to get the famous train-staff-pushing-you-into-the-train experience due to peak hours; Was very surprising and uncomfortable, but is now a memorable experience and a fun story to tell. * ~~Hachiko Statue~~ \\- *Removed as photos were adequate the night before.* * Tokyo Station - *Extremely photogenic train station* * Kokyo Gaien National Garden - *Was only able to view from the outside* * Tokyo Metro Govt Building - *Beautiful cityscape, but there was a haze/fog surrounding the city.* Lunch: Blue Plate (Curry) \\- Amazing curry, beautiful blend of spices and herbs. * Koenji - *I expected we would've spent more time here, but the walking fatigue took a toll on my family. Adding the fact that they weren't too amazed with the local scenery, the stop was cut short.* * Nakameguro (~~Night~~ Afternoon) - *Walked along Meguro River to Starbucks Reserve Roastery. Good coffee, amazing decor and layout.* * Shin-Okubo (Korea Town) - *Due to the additional time we had, we were able to visit Korea Town which was nearby our stay. Okay place, was able to witness Japanese Police in action: Calm and used numbers to surround the alleged offender's car.* Dinner: Ramen Kagetsu Arashi \\- A ramen chain restaurant. Delicious cheap ramen. On the saltier side, but I've read that Japan prefers ramen to be salty. **Day 3** (**~~7~~** **6AM)** \\- Decided to leave earlier to avoid the morning rush as we were also moving to our second and last stay place. Home Base #2: Shitte, Kawasaki * Yamashita Park - *Beautiful Park. Also saw the Hikawa Maru Museum Ship.* * Komachi Street - *Lots of street food. Ate lunch here* * Tsurugaoka Hachimangu - *Out of the 6 shrines/temples we visited, this was my favourite. The combination of very few tourists, beautiful scenery and watching the monk handwrite the calligraphy made the experience memorable.* * Hokokuji Temple - *A serene bamboo forest.* * Shonan Coastal Beach (Sunset &amp; Mt. Fuji) - *Went to this beach hoping for a shot of the sunset and Mt. Fuji together. What made this spot memorable was enjoying the sea winds and cloudy views with friendly locals. I asked a local where would you generally see Mt. Fuji and he was very kind and helpful and although we only saw a silhouette of it, we stayed to chill and listen to a couple singing.* Dinner: Kinokuniya Shokudo (Seafood Donburi) \\- Local restaurant that apparently was one of the oldest in the area. Very friendly staff with family vibes. Delicious and fresh seafood. Affordable prices. One of the top places we ate in. **Day 4 (7AM, Travel to Hakone)** Lunch: Daiyuzan Line Station Cafe (Omurice) \\- Arrived right as it opened. Cool aesthetics as it originally was a train station and they maintained the theme. Pretty pricey omurice and hamburger steak, but it was high quality Ashigara beef and soft omelette. * Amasake Tea House - *400 year old teahouse. Okay tea and desserts. Go for the vibe.* * Train to Gora Sta. (Hydrangea Viewing) - *Vibrant flowers along the train tracks. Cool train switchback mechanic to traverse the mountain.* * Hakone Venetian Glass Museum - *Beautiful museum. Everything was picturesque. The venetian glass art were all interesting to look at.* * ~~(Night) Hakoneyumotohotaru Park (Firefly viewing)~~ \\- *Cancelled. Found out to be unfeasible to get to at night without a car.* * Private Onsen - *Was able to schedule multiple time slots, so my family all had their times and loved it.* Stay at Hakone: Ajisai Onsen Ryokan \\- Affordable ryokan with 1 large outdoor onsen and 2 indoor private onsens. Everything was clean and the staff were friendly. Picked this place for its price and great reviews. However, do note that they encourage reviews by giving free drinks so even though we had a wonderful time, we don't have a frame of reference to compare it to other ryokans. **Day 5** (**~~7~~** **8AM)** \\- Slept in a little * Owakudani - *The journey was just as fun as the scenery. Once again, only got to see a silhouette of Mt. Fuji. The rotten egg smell was bearable to me, but my mom hated it so ymmv.* * Pirate Ship - *Beautiful scenes again. First Class not really necessary.* Lunch: Shinsh≈ç Soba (Soba) \\- The cold soba was delicious and refreshing on a sunny day. It was amazing to see the old aunties dashing through the restaurant, while still being friendly and accommodating. * ~~Hakone Checkpoint~~ \\- *Skipped* * ~~Ancient Cedar Avenue~~ \\- *Skipped. The walk from Hakonemachi to Motohakone port would've added almost 2km, so judging from our past days my family would've killed me on the spot if I continued with the original plan.* * Hakone Shrine - *Was still a long walk from the port. The sunshine was both a blessing and curse. The towering cedar trees were so cool. The tori gate by the sea was cool, but too many people were there.* **Day 6 (8AM)** * Your Name Stairs - *One of my top anime media. Awesome moment.* * Shitamachi Tanabata Festival - *Fun festival with an awesome backdrop of Tokyo Skytree at the end of the street. The sun forced us to cut it short and head to Ameyoko.* * ~~Kappabashi Kitchenware Town~~ \\- *Closed due to the festival* * ~~Tokyo National Museum~~ \\- *Skipped* * ~~Kiyosumi Shirakawa~~ \\- *Skipped to lessen physical activities.* * ~~(Night) Sensoji Temple / Kaminarimon Gate~~ \\- *Moved to the next day in the morning.* * Ameyoko - *Fun shopping district. This is where we did the bulk of our souvenir shopping due to the low prices.* * Notable Stores: Motoyama *(Japan made bags),* Niki no Kashi *(cheap sweets &amp; snacks)* **Day 7** (**~~8~~** **10AM)** \\- Slept in for needed rest * Nitori Furniture Store \\- *Amazing place. Arguably better than IKEA for small home products.* * Tokyo Tower / ~~Zojo-Ji~~ \\- *Took a family photo infront of the iconic tower. Zojo-ji was skipped due to time constraints and walk fatigue.* * Sensoji - *Amazing architecture. Really cool goshuin.* Lunch: Washoku Gyuuna yadoki Asakusa (Wagyu &amp; Unagi) \\- Good prices for wagyu &amp; eel. Wagyu was soft and buttery, but not melt in your mouth. Eel was very good, great sauce and removed most of the gamey taste (I like the gamey taste tho). * Tokyo Disneyland - *Went through with visiting it upon request of the family. Took pictures at the entrance and went home.* Dinner: Hama-Sushi \\- Cheap sushi. Rice still had good texture. Seafood was nice and fresh. **Day 8 (9AM)** * ~~Bonsai Village, Warehouse District~~ \\- *Skipped due to time constraints* * Akihabara - *Despite the online dislike I've seen for Akihabara, I loved this place. All the anime stores I went to were really cool. I know buying online would be cheaper, but I feel like it's almost a rite of passage to buy one in person in Akihabara.* * Notable stores: *Trader* *always had the best prices compared to the other famous ones, but had less variety.* *Gear2* *had great prices for pokemon packs and hands out free packs for reviews.* * Hie Shrine - *Beautiful shrine surrounded by city scape. Has the tori gates like in Fushimi Inari minus the crowds.* * ~~Ameyayokocho~~ \\- *Completed* * Gundam / Odaiba - *The Gundam Base was really cool. It's like a display haven of gundam.* * Unicorn Gundam - *Really cool to see a life-sized gundam.* Dinner: McDonald's - Wanted to compare the quality of fast food compared to other countries. It was definitely better. The shrimp on the ebi burger was very succulent. The ketchup was more like tomato sauce, but I still prefer the more processed version. * Haneda Airport - *Terminal 3 was a nice small airport. It's not a HKIA or Changi Airport, but it's still good.*"}

Context: second trip in Japan, group of three friends (M, 20s), interested in history / culture, two of us speak basic Japanese (1 / 2 years of college level classes). None of us can drive so we only relied on public transit / taxis. Our schedules only overlapped in summer, hence visiting in June / July. We adhere to the creed that holidays are meant to be restful rather than intense, so you won't see many early mornings or very packed days (some activities could have definitely been condensed into a single day rather than spread out). **TLDR**: Not as touristy as expected, though more people than in Kyushu. A bit too much moving around for my taste (if I were to do it again, would probably cut Kinosaki or add a day there), but nevertheless a very fun itinerary somewhat off the beaten path. **Itinerary: Hiroshima (3 nights), Okayama (2 nights), Izumo (2 nights), Kinosaki (1 night)** **Transport tips:** * Check (for peace of mind) if streetcars use ICs or not. Some do, some don‚Äôt. * Buy hand sanitiser. Many local trains / Ltd Express trains / small stations do not have soap in their bathrooms. * Google maps is your best friend for everything transport related, but also keep an eye on signs (electronic and physical), as in smaller stations it may not tell you from which platform your train departs / arrives. * Always keep JR ticket receipts, comes in handy if one of your friends loses their ticket. * This is very much a personal opinion but, despite being expensive, taxis may at times be worth it, significantly cutting otherwise complicated and lengthy travel times. I recommend using the GO Taxi app, which works in most mid-sized / major cities. **Day 0: Hiroshima** * Arrived from **Shimonoseki** quite late. Stayed right next to the station, which is a massive plus when doing day trips. * The streetcar is easy to use (IC accepted) and makes travelling from the station to the city centre pretty seamless. * The **station** has a lot of good restaurants in and around it, so you will definitely not run out of good food options if staying in the area. **Day 1: chilling in Hiroshima** * We‚Äôd been in **Hiroshima** two years ago and visited the city pretty extensively, so we didn‚Äôt hit the sights again. Instead went shopping for tea and other souvenirs, and generally enjoyed a nice day off. * Went to the **okonomimura** for dinner, the higher floors seemed less busy than the lower ones and smelled just as good. We hit some random stand, and it was pretty tasty. Overall worth visiting for the atmosphere, though IMO the okonomiyaki you can get at the station is just as good. **Day 2: Onomichi** * Took a Kodama to **Shin-Onomichi**, and then a taxi into town (15mn, 2k yen). Grabbed some Onomichi style ramen in the **Hondori shopping arcade** (long covered commercial street). Lots of food options, and a nice respite from the horrid summer sun. I recommend purchasing water / all supplies you‚Äôll need for the temple walk there, as I didn‚Äôt see that many vending machines around the town. * Was not sure if there was a specific order / direction to the temple walk, so started at the end near Onomichi JR station and proceeded eastwards. I recommend taking a photo of the map here and following the route it indicates, as most of the signs are kanji only so it is easy to miss some cool tucked away temples. Compared to Kyoto, the temples are not particularly noteworthy in terms of size or architecture, but they make up for it in their lack of tourists and views of the Seto inland sea. **Tennei temple** has a nice pagoda (I recommend taking the path that passes above it for photos). The nearby cat street is cute, though mosquito infested. * We then took the cable car up to **Senkoji park** and observation post, which offers sweeping views of the city and inland sea. From there, we walked back down through **Senkoji temple** into the city (very pretty, I recommend walking down if you can rather than taking the cable car), continued a little along the temple walk, before calling a taxi using the GO Taxi app back to Shin-Onomichi. Make sure to check Kodama schedules, as they don‚Äôt run that frequently. Overall a good day trip, definitely worth it if you are staying in Hiroshima, Okayama, or even potentially Osaka. **Day 3: Kurashiki &amp; Kojima** * Shipped our bags straight to Tokyo and packed 5 days‚Äô worth of clothes into duffels. Took the Shinkansen to **Okayama** **station**, where we dropped off our bags in coin lockers). I initially considered stopping at Shin Kurashiki instead, but since we were staying in Okayama it made more sense to drop off our bags there and take a local train to Kurashiki station (which is located right next to the sights). * **Achi jinja** offers good views of the historic centre and is worth the detour despite being a bit of a steep climb. * One of my friends is really into art, so we went to the **Ohara museum.** A rather steep entry fee, though they have a surprisingly complete collection of 19^(th) and early 20^(th) century western painters. Worth the visit if you are into art or not fussed about dropping 2 000 yen per person on an hour-ish long visit. * Walked around the canal area, very scenic. One of my friends checked out some of the denim stores, but he found them too touristy. We thus decided on a last-minute excursion to **Kojima**. * As this was last minute, we cracked the (proverbial) piggy bank and took a 30mn taxi (7k yen ish iirc). Visited a few stores including Kapital, where my friend found what he was looking for. Then took the Marine Liner back to Okayama. Overall enjoyed Kurashiki, the canals are quite quaint. Definitely doable as a day trip from Hiroshima / Okayama / Osaka. Could be coupled with a visit of Okayama castle and garden (see day 5). **Day 4: Takahashi / Bitchu Matsuyama castle** * Took the Ltd Express Yakumo (runs every hour) from Okayama to **Bitchu Takahashi station**. Takahashi station was very nice, seemingly recently renovated. The attached omiyage / bookstore and library provide a nice waiting space. * Took a taxi from the station to **Bitchu Matsuyama parking lot** (15mn, 2k yen). From there, it is an uphill (dirt path so bring good shoes) 20-30mn walk. Buy drinks at the parking lot, because there are no vending machines further up (there is a water fountain and bathroom at the top though). Hiking up a mountain under 34 degrees is not fun, but the view is definitely worth it. The castle itself is less impressive than other complexes such as Himeji, but as one of Japan‚Äôs twelve original (ie: not rebuilt post-Meiji / WW2) castles it retains its original interior design. The castle is also home to a stray cat, which was tamed by staff and made the local ‚Äúlord‚Äù. Very cute. * After making our way back down, the parking lot staff kindly called a taxi which drove us to **Raikyu-ji** temple (10mn, 1k yen). Very welcoming staff, and a magnificent garden. We also visited the two nearby **samurai houses**, which are interesting in themselves but less impressive than the ones we had seen in Kitsuki (see Kyushu itinerary). Nevertheless still worth the detour if you are in town. We then walked back to the station, and rode Yakumo back to Okayama. Overall, a highly recommended day trip, probably my favourite in the region. More remote than the other options, but definitely worth the detour. **Day 5: Okayama, Izumo** * Checked out of our lodging, dropped of our bags at the station and then made our way to **Okayama** **castle** and **garden**. * The castle is nice from the outside, didn‚Äôt try to go in. The garden has good views, though I found the one in Kanazawa more impressive. Note that the closest streetcar stop is approx 10mn walk away from the entrance. * Ate lunch at the station, and then rode the Yakumo Ltd Express all the way to **Izumo**. A long but pleasant ride, with pretty views of the mountains of western Japan as well as the expansive lake Shinji. Note that JR Izumoshi station is actually a 20mn drive away from the Izumo-taisha sanctuary and nearby town. We took a taxi to our lodging, but a local company also operates services between the JR station and the shrine (transfer required iirc). * Dinner options near the shrine are very limited, so we ate at the hotel. Walked around **Inasa beach** during sunset, very beautiful. Even local dog walkers were snapping photos of the torii gate with a golden Sea of Japan as backdrop. **Day 6: Izumo, Matsue** * Began the day with **Izumo Taisha**. It was moderately busy, though still pleasant. The shrine‚Äôs architecture is quite interesting, exhibiting a rather rare native style. Most sighs are in Japanese, but Wikipedia provides an extensive overview of the legends and history of the site. I think the tourism office (located between the shrine and Izumo-taisha station) also offers guided tours. * We grabbed local soba on the main shopping street (really goof, highly recommend), before taking the Ichibata line to **Matsue**. Trains run every hour-ish, with a five minute transfer in Kawato. Transfer announcements are in Japanese only, though the station is so small you‚Äôll definitely be able to find the right train. The Ichibata station in Matsue is pretty centrally located (approx 20mn walk from the castle). * **Matsue castle** is another one of the twelve original castles, and is the only one in the San‚Äôin region. Far more ‚Äústandard‚Äù looking than its Bitchu Matsuyama counterpart, it reminded me a bit of Hiroshima castle (chibi version). The interior is definitely worth a visit, with the top floor offering sweeping views of the city and nearby countryside. The castle‚Äôs shrine also has a nice goshuin. * I really enjoyed walking around the **moat** and through the nearby samurai district, the interesting twists and curves of old trees proving most scenic. It seems boat tours run along the moat, which could be a fun experience. Wanted to visit Hearn‚Äôs house, but it was closed. City museum was also closed by the time we passed in front of it. Rode the Ichibata back to Izumo-taisha station, and ate a very good dinner at a nearby izakaya. Overall, a well-packed day. If I were to go again, I would probably split off Matsue into a fully-fledged day trip, as we arrived too late to see many of its sights. **Day 7: Tottori, Kinosaki** * Took an early Ltd Express from Izumo to **Tottori**. Do be careful, as there are only 2-3 a day. One of the shakiest train rides I‚Äôve been on in Japan, could not catch up on sleep. * Took a taxi from Tottori station to the **sand dunes** (15mn, 3k yen). Worth the detour if you are passing by, otherwise can skip. There are a few curry restaurants around the station, and the one we tried was very good. * We missed the 12:58 Ltd express, so instead rode local trains to **Kinosaki**. Some local trains have toilets (squat), others don‚Äôt, so do be careful. Also, do make sure to keep receipts when buying train tickets, it does come in handy when one of your friends loses theirs. * Checked in to our ryokan. Arrived too late to try the public baths, but the ryokan itself had a sufficient selection for one night. Ropeway was closed, so I attempted to get a goshuin from the nearby **Shishojinja**, but its office was also closed. Had dinner at the ryokan. **Day 8: Tokyo** * Took the 7:13 Ltd Express Hamakaze to Himeji, then Shinkansen to Tokyo (had to be there for lunch). I hope this helps anyone planning a trip in the region. It was a pretty light itineary, which could probably have been further condensed with more determination and clement weather. If I were to do it again, I would probably cut off Kinosaki, and instead add a day to Izumo (from which I would then have gone directly to Tokyo by plane). Happy to answer any questions!"}

First of all, thank you to those who commented on my itinerary post. I wanted to provide a trip report because it was truly a spectacular trip with a few lessons. There's only one place I wouldn't really go out of my way to visit, but otherwise it was an amazing first trip to Japan. I'm pasting the main itinerary below with my thoughts, comments, and advice! I've crossed out the days where my plans changed to show how nice it is to be flexible even with a tight timeframe. I hope this helps other solo travelers who are planning itineraries around Kyushu. I spent three weeks in Tokyo for work before flying down to Kagoshima, so I'm only going to focus on this part. **Details** **Saturday, May 31 - Heading to Kagoshima** * Take an early flight from Tokyo to Kagoshima (arrive 8:30 am). * Drop off bag at hotel, then take a ferry to Sakurajima (around 11 am). * Explore the island for the day and return by ferry. * Enjoy evening eats, walking around, and visit a bar to try some sh≈çch≈´. \\[Try to check out Ishizue for shochu.\\] Accommodation: You Style Hotel Marine **NOTES:** Kagoshima airport is far from the city, but the airport bus is right outside and is very affordable and easy to understand the departure times. The bus actually stops at two places in the city, which is great because the second and last stop was close to my hotel. Taking the early flight was great because I had enough time to drop off my bags until check in and walk to the ferry to head to Sakurajima. I definitely recommend going as it is a very beautiful island to walk around and the erupting volcano is picturesque. I only hopped on the island bus to reach spots I couldn't reasonably walk. There's also nice cafe and gift shop in the ferry building to have a drink of any kind. I highly recommend visiting Ishizue shochu bar. I ended up making some incredible friends who later in the trip drove me all around Fukuoka. I was invited to join them in Ibusuki for the hot sand bath, but I didn't want to miss visiting Yakushima. **Sunday, June 1 - Heading to Yakushima** * Take a morning ferry from Kagoshima to Yakushima (Miyanoura; arrive 9:45 am). (arranged by Yes! Yakushima) * Rent a car and drive around the island. (arranged by Yes! Yakushima) * Hike Yakusugi Land/Shiratani Unsuikyo. Accommodation for all nights: Yaedake Sanso Lodge (arranged by Yes! Yakushima) **NOTES:** Visiting Yakushima for three days was one of the highlights of my trips. The only thing I would do differently is arrange all of the logistics myself and not use Yes! Yakushima. There is nothing wrong with the service, but I just don't think it's necessary. Of course, as everyone states, I highly recommend renting a car. It's simple. I paid in cash and made sure to have insurance. It was my first time driving abroad, but with my IDP and being extra careful it was a breeze! I saw a few travelers relying on the buses, but I often saw them waiting a very long time. Renting a car allowed me to drive straight to Shiratani Unsuikyo to start the hike around noon. It was a bright, hot and sunny day! Best thing ever: Renting hiking gear! I'm a one-bagger, so I didn't want to bring any boots. I got fitted and rented some hiking boots from a small shop near the port. The older man who owned the shop doesn't speak any English, but he is very kind and the total cost to rent for three days was only about $10 USD. These boots made hiking and crossing slippery rocks and streams a breeze. I did not stay in the lodge as it was fully booked. Instead I stayed on the southern part of the island (highly recommended!) at a beautiful family owned place called SHIKINOYADO. They don't offer meals as part of the accommodations anymore, but the stay is amazing and the location is great. They have a lot of drinks and snacks you can buy on site. I highly recommend the two beers made on the island. They were very tasty and I had one on the rooftop after each night or in my private open-air bathroom. **Monday, June 2 -** **~~Hiking in Yakushima~~** **Driving around Yakushima on a Rainy Day** All day hike to Jomon Sugi. **NOTES:** It rained all day, but it wasn't too hard. So instead of the long hike to Jomon Sugi I got in the car and drove around the island to find all of the waterfalls and lighthouses, drink yummy local tangerine juice, and enjoy all of the cute monkeys and deer. With frequent stops for photos and juice, it took me about 6 hours or so to drive the whole way around. So beautiful! I ended the day with a nice private bath outdoors. **Tuesday, June 3 -** **~~Snorkeling in Yakushima~~** **Hiking Yakusugi Land** * ~~Have a nice breakfast and then head to the beaches in the morning.~~ * ~~Meet up with the Yes! Yakushima group at 1:00 pm for snorkeling.~~ **NOTES:** It rained lightly in the morning, but it wasn't a lot. I woke up early and picked up some pastries and coffee at an amazing bakery (I'll edit to add the info once I find it). I decided to start hiking Yakusugi Land even when it was a little drizzly. Best decision! After about 30 minutes on the boardwalk, you'll pass those on guided tours and will step off into the beautiful, dense forest for another 3 hours or so. With it raining, there were a few steep and slippery sections, but nothing good hiking boots couldn't handle. At the end of the day, I went to a local hot spring (Onoaida Hot Spring) recommended by the family running the inn. There were only locals there, and it was amazing. They helped me to learn onsen etiquette, and everyone was friendly. Yakushima was very beautiful, and I was lucky to have a sunny day to hike as well as a slightly overcast and rainy day in Yakusugi Land. I was nervous about getting rained out since as locals say it rains 445 days of the year there, but even with the rain it was as beautiful as ever and the waterfalls were swelling. **Wednesday, June 4 -** **~~Heading to Kagoshima~~** **Heading to Kumamoto** * Take a morning ferry from Miyanoura port back to Kagoshima and arrive around 12:30 pm. * ~~Head to Sengan-en in the afternoon via bus from the train station.~~ * ~~End the day at Shiroyama Park and head down for some evening eats and maybe a little more shochu.~~ * ~~Pick up a rental car at the Kagoshima Station.~~ Accommodation: GuestHouse Carapan **NOTES:** Instead of renting a car in Kagoshima, I decided to take a train to Kumamoto and spend one night in the city there. After making friends in Kagoshima, I moved up my timeline by one day so that I could have more time in Fukuoka to spend with them. I thought it would be better for me to be based in Kumamoto since my next major activity was hiking in the Aso area. It was a short train ride from Kagoshima and getting to my hotel near the castle was easy. The castle is under construction due to damage caused by an earthquake, but since I arrived around 4 pm I walked around briefly and took a few photos. I spent the rest of the evening walking around the shopping district, and then I found a smash burger and local brewery. The owner was so friendly, and the local brews were fantastic! I ended up buying her a drink and we enjoyed sipping and chatting the night away. Kumamoto makes a great base, but there definitely is not a ton to do in the city. A half day was perfect. **Thursday, June 5 -** **~~Hiking around Kirishima National Park~~** **Hiking Around the Aso Region** * ~~Drive to Kirishima National Park early a.m. (approx. ).~~ * Hike around and the spend the night somewhere nearby. Accommodation: Ê£Æ„ÅÆÊ∏©Ê≥âÈÉ∑ ÈúßÂ≥∂Ê∏©Ê≥â„Åø„ÇÑ„Åæ„Éõ„ÉÜ„É´ **Notes:** I checked out of my hotel and rented a car from the Toyota-Rent-a Center just south of the Kumamoto train station at 8 am the next morning. It was the smoothest and easiest experience ever! I booked online just a day or two in advance, and everything was prepared for me. The car was fantastic. Who knew renting a car could be a wonderful experience itself? I drove to the Sensuikyo Parking Lot because I decided to do the long hike up Mt. Takadake (the tallest of the five Aso peaks). Unfortunately, there were not any places to rent hiking boots, so I somewhat foolishly decided to do the technical hike anyway. While I do not recommend hiking unprepared as the volcano has VERY loose rocks, steep inclines (really was just rock climbing at points), and steep descents, it was THE highlight of my trip. Maybe more so are as much as my time on Yakushima island. Local hikers were so kind to me along the way. One person gave me half a cob of corn. Another person lent me his hiking poles to get down a steep section, and another person gave me a pack of grape gum. The views of the highlands and the multiple peaks were spectacular. I also hiked when the azaleas were in full bloom at the peak. You can only see them if you are able to hike up and over to the other side. You can view my hike on all trails here if you'd like. Somehow it only took me 5 hours, but it was definitely a brutal hike during the heat of the day (11 am to about 4 pm). The little shop in the parking lot was not open on the day for some reason, but there was a little vending machine for me to get tons of water and drinks to rehydrate. I hoped back in the car and drove to the observation deck to look down into the volcano. The drive up to this point was also stunning, and there were a few places where you could pull over to take photos. It wasn't crowded since the top closed at 5 pm. I made it around 4:30/4:45 and was allowed to take my time enjoying the view. I stayed at the Aso Backpackers Hostel in a private room/shared bath, and it was so lovely! They have a private parking lot, so parking was a breeze. **Friday, June 6 - Heading to Takachiho Gorge and Staying in a Ryokan in Kurokawa Onsen** * Drive to Takachiho Gorge (approx. 2.5 hours). * Rent a kayak and paddle around. * Explore Takachiho-jinja Shrine. * Sleep here. Accommodation: ~~3094 Takamori~~ **Notes:** I checked out the hostel and drove to Takachiho Gorge early in the a.m. Again, the drive around this entire highland/grasslands/volcanic region is itself such a beautiful adventure. I only wish I would have spent MORE time just driving among all of the farms and rice paddies. I reserved a boat in advance for 9:30 a.m. and arrived early enough to be able to get a parking spot down at the boat loading spot. Since I was early, I walked around the Gorge and pretty much saw everything there was to see in the area in about 30/40 very leisurely minutes. Personally, I don't think the boat rental was really worth it. You only have 30 minutes, and you're battling with all the other paddlers. While the gorge is nice, I think it's not worth a visit if you don't have a ton of time. It's at most a half-day experience. After the brutal hike the other day, I'd made up in my mind that I wanted to go onsen hopping in Kurokawa and that I wanted to stay at one of the ryokans if I could. The drive from the Gorge was about 45 minutes I think, and I arrived around 12:30. I picked up a pass and a towel and hopped around to 2 onsens before checking in at Okyakuya Ryokan. I ended up getting a really good last minute deal through Booking.com. If you look in advance at the official site, most places will be sold out, but don't get discouraged. You can still get a good deal at the last minute. It was a beautiful stay with a private onsen as well as indoor and outdoor onsens. My stay was for half-board (breakfast service no dinner), but it was not a problem because there was still a dinner menu I could purchase from. The room was very large, and the service was spectacular all around. They even give you plenty of things you take home with you (such as the socks and the onsen towel they provide in the room). I got all dressed up in the nice yukata and headed back out to visit my last onsen. I ordered dinner from my room, and they had it prepared and called me to a semi-private dining room where they served me. I enjoyed a local beer while waiting for dinner, and then went to the onsen afterwards (stays open pretty much 24/7 for guests). **Saturday, June 7 -** **~~Heading to Aso-San~~** **Heading to Fukuoka** * ~~Get an early start to the day and drive to Mount Aso.~~ * ~~Spend the day hiking the trails. (which trails are TBD since most areas are closed off)~~ ~~Accommodation: also 3094 Takamori~~ **Notes:** Check out was at 10 am and the rental car needed to be returned by 10. The problem was that my breakfast was arranged for 8 am. Before breakfast, I woke up and enjoyed a few more morning dips in the onsen. This time there was a group of 5 older ladies who had been friends for over 45 years enjoying the outdoor onsen. They were very friendly and made it a great morning. Since they serve you a big spread in the semi-private dining room, the breakfast time was not changeable. I almost left without eating, but I just couldn't since I wanted to continue enjoying the experience. The food was excellent and many of the dishes came from the ryokan's organic farm. Fresh milk, yogurt, homemade tofu, and all sorts of other dishes. I even tried horse sashimi! The ryokan staff members checked the menu with me at check in, and I said it was fine to keep. I miscalculated how long it would take me to drive back to Kumamoto, but the Toyota-Rent-a Center was awesome and I was able to return the car two hours later for a very small fee after I gave them a call. After dropping off the car, I walked right to the train station across the street and took a fast train to Fukuoka. I changed much of the end of my trip to accommodate my new friends who wanted to show me around their city! I checked into a hotel near Hakata station, which was perfect since my stay would be short. It is a little walk to the main areas, but I love walking so it wasn't a problem. After checking in, I walked to have some famous hakata ramen at Shin Shin. It was delicious! If you go to Google Reviews, I'm sure you'll see my post. After having a meal, I did a little souvenir shopping and walked around the area. I found a cute cafe and **Sunday, June 8 -** **~~Aso-San and Kurokawa Onsen~~** **Fukuoka** * ~~Get another early morning start and more hiking around Mt. Aso.~~ * ~~Then, drive to Kurokawa Onsen (approx. 30 minutes) in the early afternoon for check-in at 3 pm.~~ * ~~Enjoy onsen-hopping.~~ * ~~Spend the night at Yamabiko Ryokan.~~ Accommodation: Yamabiko Ryokan **Notes:** My new friends picked me up in their car, and we drove to Dazaifu Tenmangu. It was nice and has an amazing history. The grounds were beautifully landscaped. We walked around, took some photos, and enjoyed window shopping around the shopping street while we waited to be next in line for the restaurant they chose. We had a warm snack that was filled with red bean paste and some fresh juice. I'll have to look up the place, but there's a restaurant right near the gate that looks modern with dark and dim lighting indoors and long lines. We waited for about 45 minutes I think, but the food was delicious. We each had the wagyu beef lunch set which came with cod roe a fluffy egg over rice, soba, pickled veggies, etc. It was tasty and a nice dining experience. Then, we drove to the Kyushu National Museum since it was raining. Finally, we drove back to town and had some yakitori over drinks in a smoky restaurant near my hotel because we didn't want the day to end. After we parted, I met up with a fellow traveler vis-a-vis Bumble, and we stumbled on a beer festival! A great evening. **Monday, June 9 - Fukukoa** * ~~A few more morning dips in the onsen.~~ * ~~Then, drive to Fukuoka. (approx. 1.5 hours; aim to be in Fukuoka by 12 pm)~~ * ~~Drive around the Itoshima Peninsula~~ * ~~Visit the Fukuoka Tower and return the rental car.~~ * ~~Enjoy some food at a yatai.~~ ~~Accommodation: Lamp Light Books Hotel - Fukuoka~~ **Notes:** Originally, I planned on doing a day trip down to Nagasaki, but it was pouring rain that way and not a little. Instead, I stayed around the city and went to the Asian Art Museum (a nice way to spend a few hours), did a bit more shopping (finally found some good matcha and had an incredible sencha tea experience at Fukuoka JapanTea Studio, highly recommend!), and spent one more evening with my Bumble friend. We both finally visited a yatai and made more kind friends over drinks! **Tuesday, June 10 - Heading to Tokyo** Getting to the airport in Fukuoka is so easy if you're near the Hakata station. It's only a short 5 minute ride! **Wednesday, June 11 - Heading back to the U.S.** All in all, I highly recommend visiting Kyushu even on your first visit to Japan if you have the time. Next time I return, I'd like to make it out to Nagasaki and Miyazaki! I'd also like to spend more time around the southern areas of Kagoshima."}

We definitely enjoyed them but I came away with some specific thoughts based on the current state of the exhibits/experiences. (I researched this on reddit prior to our trip and wanted to provide this report based on our current 2025 comparison): **Borderless** * Despite high attendance, Borderless overall felt manageable, spacious, and not cramped. We waited almost no time to enter with our timed ticket (and even if we had the wait would have been indoors). * Borderless felt clean despite the huge number of people cycling through. No small feat. * At least one exhibit in Borderless was being repaired and thus was off limits. No idea which one it was and we didn't feel a lack (there was such a huge variety of rooms and experiences there vs Planets which really has just the four main sections). * The video projection experience at Borderless felt better than planets. Newer? More projectors? Different video stitching tech? There were fewer occlusions/shadows based on where people were standing and the alignment of multiple projectors never felt misaligned. * Tea room was slow to get into and while fun was the least important part of the experience. Felt the most gimmicky and while it was a nice way to end the experience I don't think you are missing much if you don't do it. If you can, sure, but not sure it warranted the wait. * Overall Borderless gave us more of the experience of being in a cohesive, endless space of \"things to be discovered and puzzled over.\" * Hallways were the biggest bottlenecks but even then I never really felt like I was stuck waiting for others or constrained by other guests. I would have preferred 20% fewer attendees but even with the capacity we experienced it was fine. We never had to jostle for space. **Planets** * We had a timed ticket for entry just like with Borderless but we ended up waiting about 20-30 minutes outside in the queue for entry. Given the heat right now it was a pretty brutal way to start the experience. * In general Planets suffers more from the \"high traffic, high touch\" problem many interactive museums have: it often felt much grimier than Borderless. A lot of the flooring materials had been patched with duct tape in places, for example. Not a big detraction from the overall experience but it just felt a lot more worn out at times than Borderless. * In this vein, some of the non touch aspects also felt a little off. One of the aquarium rooms (draw creatures, they come to life) had video stitching that was out of alignment. It's trivial but it breaks the immersion experience significantly. * The water experience was one of the best parts and obviously shared conceptual/executional DNA with the tea room at Borderless but was much more enjoyable. People were well behaved in the water room and it was also the most peaceful part of the Planets experience for us. * I wish that we'd been able to take our shoes off just once and store them and our small personal bags in lockers and be done with it at the start (Borderless has a single bag check in comparison). However planets has you remove and store your shoes/bags in lockers multiple times and given the high number of attendees (many of whom were not practiced at shoes on/off, etc.) it was a serious bottleneck. * We saw a lot more staff coming and going into back rooms which sort of broke the immersion experience. We'd be in a cool endless corridor and then suddenly a door would open with cardboard boxes stacked up on the other brightly lit side. Again, minor, but as a comparison Borderless just nailed more of this kind of thing. * In comparison to Borderless the staff presence and sheep-dogging at Planets was a LOT more active/present. It was obviously necessary due to the design of the exhibits and how poorly people can behave in places like this, but it gave the experience more of a policed vibe which took just a bit of the spontaneous fun out at times. A \"tragedy of the commons\" problem that is hard to overcome in high touch exhibits but I ended up enjoying Borderless more as a result. Our fav parts of Planets? Water room and flower immersion room. Our fav parts of Borderless? Lily room, sphere/cube rooms, marching parade of weird creatures, overall sense of being in a real organic, dynamic, magical place. Our least fav parts of both? People who didn't heed the briefing to try and be calm/quiet/keep-some-control-over-their-kids. Inevitable but selfish travelers are the worst."}

We own an arcade bar in Brooklyn NY, so we prioritized seeing arcades and arcade culture in Japan. She is also an animal lover and wanted to experience some of the places to see animals in natural environments (as well as a few cafes). We are also both cyclists and planned to travel out to the Seto Inland Sea to cycle the Shimanami Kaido. Here was our day by day itinerary if it helps anyone! **Day 1 (Tues)- Land in Narita, travel to Shinjuku** We decided to fly in and out of Narita since it was less expensive. Before the flight, we got eSIM cards and set up the Suica card in our Apple Wallets to easily travel through the train system. We landed and took the Narita express to Shinjuku station. We decided to stay in Shinjuku during both of our Tokyo legs due to the nightlife, bar and izakaya scenes. For the first 3 nights of the trip we stayed at the Shinjuku Granbell Hotel which was a little more expensive but we wanted a nicer place to decompress and adjust to jetlag. **Day 2 (Weds)- Shinjuku, Nakano Broadway** We woke up at 6am due to jetlag and checked out Don Quijote which was across the street. It's a little overwhelming so glad we got to see it before our big shopping spree later in the trip. At 11am we went to the Square Enix Artnia cafe, which is a cute gift shop/cafe attached to the Square Enix HQ. They have a small menu but I recommend it if you're a fan of Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, etc. They open at 11 and it filled up quickly so recommend getting there as close to opening as possible. Since it was a bit rainy we decided to go to Nakano Broadway which is a big indoor mall about 15 min from Shinjuku station. We spent about 3 hours here but were very exhausted from the jetlag. There's a lot of great stuff though, especially if you're looking for vintage games or anime/manga. We ate Tsukemen at Enji afterward which was incredible. At night we went to the Tokyo Metropolitan Building to see the projection show. This show happens twice per night and highly recommend if you get a chance to see it! **Day 3 (Thurs)- Meiji Jingu, Shibuya, Harajuku** The weather was beautiful so we started with Meiji Jingu shrine. There were a lot of tourists but the park is beautiful. We walked through the park and over the bridge into Shibuya (this day was the most walking we did on the entire trip and it might have been a better idea to take the train). Went to Shibuya Parco to see the Nintendo, Pokemon, and Capcom stores. They were all SUPER crowded and a little overwhelming (we later found these same stores in Osaka and it was much more chill). Ate sushi on the top floor of Parco which was fine. Walked through the Scramble (we're New Yorkers so this was kinda meh for us) and to I'm Donut? which had a surprisingly short line at that time of day. Grabbed some donuts and hopped on the train to Harajuku. Walked down Takeshita street - some highlights were 6% Doki Doki and Kiddyland if you're into the vibe of this area. My wife also got Onitsuka Tigers at their flagship store. We ended up grabbing a late dinner at Family Mart and crashing **Day 4 (Fri)- Travel to Imabari** We sent most of our luggage to Osaka and checked out of the Granbell with backpacks and headed toward the Shimanami Kaido bike trip. The Shinkansen bullet train goes to Fukuyama, where we found a bus that travels over the same route we'd be cycling (you can also take a train, but we wanted the scenic above-ground tour of the islands). This was all much easier than I expected. We bought the Shinkansen tickets the night before and got the bus tickets right at the station. We arrived in Imabari and checked into Cyclo No IE, which is a hostel/guesthouse for cyclists. The hosts were extremely helpful and showed us different routes for the bike path. We walked around Imabari and had Yakitori at a small local joint before going to bed early **Day 5 (Sat)- Shimanami Kaido Day 1** We woke up early and had a big breakfast before picking up our rental bikes across the street from the hostel. I purchased these in advance so all we needed to do was show our code and pick up the bikes along with locks, lights, and helmets. The first day was a bit overcast which was actually nice to bike in. Follow the blue line! That's my biggest suggestion for this ride. We went off track almost at the very beginning and it set us back almost 45 minutes. We intentionally went out of the way on the island Oshima to see a nice rose garden and eat at Cafe Shozan. The next island, Hakatajima, has a nice beach but the weather wasn't that great. We stayed on the third island Omishima at the Benton Guesthouse. They had a laundry which was much appreciated, as well as dinner recommendations nearby. **Day 6 (Sun)- Rabbit Island, Shimanami Kaido Day 2** The reason we stayed on Omishima was so that we could wake up early and take the ferry to Okunoshima or Rabbit Island. We brought a head of cabbage and some carrots and it was well worth it! Caught the earliest ferry (9am) so we could get there before the second half of the bike trip. The rabbits will absolutely swarm you for food. It was quite adorable and definitely recommend doing this as part of the bike trip if you're nearby. We got back to the guesthouse by noon and continued on our way. The fourth island Ikuchijima has the most to see. It's also known for lemons, so I recommend getting a lemonade in town. It was VERY hot so we got out of the sun inside the Cave of 1000 Buddhas in the Kousanji Temple. The Hill of Hope was also worth seeing as part of this temple experience. Since we spent so much time on Ikuchijima, we had to cycle through Innoshima and Mukaishima without stopping too much. We ended up getting on the ferry to Onomichi around 5pm and returned our bikes before the rental shop closed at 6pm. We stayed at a pretty basic hotel in Onomichi, the Kokusai Hotel which was actually nicer than I expected (and MUCH cheaper than the U2 hotel that they recommend for cyclists) **Shimanami Kaido Conclusions-** the bike trip was incredible! It was 80 km (\\~40 miles) total split over two days. There were a few hills getting up to the bridges but our bikes had gears and it wasn't terribly difficult. We met some folks doing the entire ride in one day, though we stopped frequently to take photos and sightsee. Definitely worthwhile if you're a fan of cycling. **Day 7 (Mon)- Naoshima, Travel to Osaka** This was maybe our biggest mistake of the trip. The Shinkansen takes an hour to get to Osaka so we had a lot of time to kill before checking into our hotel, so decided to stop at Okoyama, drop our bags in a locker, and take the local train followed by a ferry to Naoshima. However we didn't realize it was Monday and ALL the museums were closed that day. It was also pushing 100 degrees. We set out to walk the perimeter of Naoshima and got diverted by so many closed roads that we ended up on a pretty serious hike just to see one of Yayoi Kusama's pumpkins. We took photos, found a bus, and got back on the ferry. I'd say don't bother going to this island unless the museums are open! We also could have allocated way more time than a half day (it takes a while to get there and back) Got to Osaka, had some shabu shabu and crashed at the Hearton Hotel in Shinsaibashi **Day 8 (Tues)- Osaka, Shinsaibashi, Dotonbori** Spent the day shopping around Shinsaibashi and had incredible Takoyaki and Okonomayaki in Dotonbori for lunch. Met up with some friends we knew at the RockBarCherryBomb in the evening. One of our contacts had a bar called Space Station, which is located in America-Mura and was filled with vintage game consoles and other video game art. Highly recommend if you're into retro gaming. **Day 8 (Weds)- Osaka, Namba, Teppanyaki** We walked to Namba in the morning to see the Yasaka Jinja shrine, then headed to DenDen Town to hang in the AC with one of our expat friends. (This area is sort of a mini Akihabara for you electronics freaks) On our way back we stopped for Omurice at Muguni which was one of the best things I ate on the entire trip. There's only 10 seats but it's worth the wait! We had dinner reservations at Kobebeef Teppanyaki Rio which was our ONE dinner reservation of the entire trip. The dinner was incredible, we got a prix fixe of wagyu beef and a bottle of wine. Came out to around $400 USD for 2 people but totally worth it. Walked back to Shinsaibasi. Between Muguni and the Teppanyaki this was by far the best food day of the trip. **Day 9 (Thurs)- Nara, Travel to Kyoto** We again shipped our big luggage back to Tokyo and packed a small two day bag for Kyoto. On the way, we went to Nara Park to see the deer. Just like the rabbits, they were food driven. My wife got one pack of crackers and was immediately swarmed. We walked around to both shrines in the park. I'd recommend Todai-ji if you only have time for one (the giant Buddha is incredible) but just be aware both shrines have added fees to get inside. After Nara we traveled to Kyoto where we were staying for 2 nights. Since my wife and I both have tattoos we decided to get a room at Soraniwa Terrace with a private Onsen since we were long overdue for an onsen after that bike trip. This hotel has a rooftop with complementary drinks at sunset and a foot bath. It's totally worth the splurge. They gave us a fridge full of complementary champagne and other drinks (and refilled it every day!) The onsen was also very much needed. At night we checked out a small cafe called Cafe La Siesta owned by a local chiptune artist. They sometimes have performances but not on the night we went. Played some Super Famicom and had some cocktails, very cool little spot! **Day 10 (Fri)- Arashiyama, Nishiki Market, Fushimi Inari** This was our one full day in Kyoto and it was jam packed. We decided to start at the bamboo forest in Arashiyama (be sure to check out the Kimono Forest at the train station!). It's very crowded but we found a space near the end of the trail where we could take beautiful pictures and no one was around. Went to Nishiki Market for lunch, and my advice is to try as many small things as possible. This was another one of the best food experiences of the entire trip. Also found some sweet bomber jackets at a shop nearby! Decided to hike Fushimi Inari at sundown (it was so hot once again) which turned out to be the correct decision. It was not terribly crowded and we were able to hike to the summit which took about 3 hours round trip. One of the best parts of the trip, definitely do this if you are in Kyoto. **Day 11 (Sat)- Travel back to Tokyo** We forwarded our luggage to the APA Higashi which was very close to the Granbell where we stayed on the earlier leg of the trip. We went to Kabukicho Tower to play some games in the Bandai Namco arcade and went to Omoide Yokocho for a yakitori dinner. Ended the night at Star Club, a Nintendo-themed bar where we played Mario Kart against some other tourists **Day 12 (Sun) - Yakult Swallows Baseball Game, Harajuku** I'm a big baseball fan in the US and wanted to check out a game in Tokyo, so we got tix in advance to see the Yakult Swallows host the Orix Buffaloes. The game was incredible but VERY hot. My only regret is that we had to get out of the sun for an innning when Yakult hit their only home run, so we missed the umbrella celebration. Walked to Harajuku at night to check out the otter sanctuary. Out of all the animal experiences this was maybe my favorite (maybe because the otters weren't food driven?) Definitely recommend for animal lovers. We went to Kura Sushi for dinner which was a blast. I can't believe how much sushi we got and how cheap it was. **Day 13 (Mon) - Ghibli Museum, Mitaka** We did NOT expect to get tickets to the Ghibli Museum but somehow randomly we got lucky! So this day was dedicated to that neighborhood. If you're a Ghibli fan definitely check it out. We spent about 2.5 hours there. We met up with another game developer we knew at the Pico Pico Cafe (which is currently undergoing renovations, but is similar in vibe to Cafe La Siesta) and then headed to the Capy Neko Cafe to pet a Capybara. On the way out of Minato we stopped by Corn Barley which is a Ghibli themed restaurant with a prix fixe menu - ALL the dishes are from different Ghibli films. Very cute. Again, if you love Ghibli I highly recommend it. **Day 14 (Tues) - Akihabara** I knew I was going to buy too much stuff to lug around so Akiba was scheduled for the end of the trip for this reason. Started at the weird vending machines which were honestly underwhelming. We briefly popped into Radio Kaikan which was a mistake because most stores closed at 6 and we took too long getting back here to really explore. If you‚Äôre an electronics hobbyist, definitely prioritize this. Got a few LED strips and hobbyist things but wish I got to explore more. HEY (Hirose Entertainment Yard) was probably the best arcade of the entire trip. Retro, rhythm games, Candy cabs, they have everything. Went to Super Potato and ended up buying a Famicom. Also stopped by BEEP which had a slightly better selection of games. Lots of other great shops. I don‚Äôt need to tell you all about Akihabara but for me, 6 hours was not nearly enough time. In the evening we went to Donki to buy luggage and souvenirs. We packed and weighed them so we knew how much space we had left for our last day. **Day 15 (Weds) - Gotokuji Temple, Shimokitazawa, TeamLabs Planets** June is the ‚Äúrainy season‚Äù but this was the 3rd day of rain we had. It poured while we were at Gotokuji which was actually kind of nice and serene. Went to Shimokitazawa afterward and I‚Äôm glad we packed everything because there are a TON of vintage clothing stores here that could have been problematic. Next time. We had TeamLabs tickets for the evening so we took a train to the Unicorn Gundam, grabbed some food and headed to Planets. I picked this one because of the water experience. We had a blast. I can‚Äôt compare it to Borderless but it reminded me a bit of Meow Wolf in the states **Day 16 (Thurs) - Bus to Narita** APA had a shuttle bus that goes directly to Narita so we opted for this instead of the train. It passes Odaiba and Disney so was a nice trip. **Overall** this was a jam packed trip. We both knew we‚Äôd be walking a lot and traveling a lot. We did 7 hotels total (6 of them through booking.com). We bought all of the train tickets at the station or 30 min in advance. Navigation was SO easy, and I definitely recommend using the station entrance numbers when navigating larger stations like Shinjuku. Other advance purchases/reservations: Ghibli Museum Yakult Swallows baseball game Kobebeef Teppanyaki Rio Shimanami Kaido rental bike TeamLabs Planets (bought the night before) With such a large itinerary I don‚Äôt really have any regrets. Of COURSE I would have loved to stay longer in every place and see more but I feel like we really did as much as we possibly could with our time. Happy to answer any questions in the comments! Sorry this was so long but hopefully it‚Äôs helpful for folks!"}

After being absolutely captivated and enthralled on my previous trip, I booked another trip within a week and a half after returning. This was my first ever solo trip. **Day One (Sunday) - Landed at Haneda** I flew Japan Airlines and landed at Haneda at 5 pm. Unlike my previous trip, immigration and customs was quick (&lt;30 minutes). I had my QR code ready but the airport set up about 20 kiosks for people to scan their passport and take a photo. The QR code wasn‚Äôt needed at all. However, baggage claim took around 25 minutes. It felt like my luggage was never going to appear. I began to get worried that the airline had lost my luggage. Most people from my flight had left the area but finally, my suitcase appeared. I quickly completed the essentials (wifi box, currency exchange, welcome suica) and rode the trains to my hotel, Sotetsu Fresa Inn Okachimachi in Ueno. The hotel rooms were small but clean and adequate. This room had an adjustable thermostat and air conditioning unlike my previous Tokyo hotel which only had central heating. However, the laundry facilities here were dreadful as there were only two combo washer/dryers for the entire 13 floors. **Day Two (Monday) - Kichijoji, Nakano** * Inokashira Park * Kichijoji Shopping Street * Nakano Broadway Been seeing a lot of reddit posts talking about Kichijoji so i decided to check it out. Before that, I had an early 7 am breakfast at Komeda‚Äôs Coffee at Ueno. I took the train to Kichijoji Station and I walked around Inokashira Park but didn't go to the Ghibli Museum (i‚Äôm not interested in Ghibli). It was raining pretty hard so I was drenched walking through the park. There were very few people walking around so it was calm and peaceful despite the downpour. After leaving the park, I went to a 7/11 to buy an umbrella. Got coffee at Light Up Coffee and walked through Kichijoji Shopping Street. It‚Äôs a great walk with a variety of stores .It began lightly snowing which was awesome as I had never seen snow falling before. Circled around a couple times, bought some pastries at Linde Kichij≈çji, and hopped on the train to Nakano Broadway. Perhaps it was due to the rain but there were less tourists in Nakano Broadway than I expected. The mall has multiple levels with many Mandarake stores dedicated to collectible figures and anime merch. There is also a supermarket on the lowest level. The surrounding streets and alleyways are filled with restaurants. I grabbed some curry at Garaku Nakano - it was soupy and delicious. I got a haircut and shave in the evening which was refreshing. **Day Three (Tues) - Yanaka, Ueno** * Shinobazu Pond * Nippori Station * Yanaka Ginza/Sendagi/Nezu Began my morning walking around Shinobazu Pond and Shinobazu Pond Benten. This is my second time walking the Ueno Park area and I love it for its peacefulness and green scenery. I walked all the way to Kayaba Coffee for breakfast. I walked in and got lucky they had an open table with no wait. The egg sando and mixed coffee and chocolate ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù drink was delicious and lightly sweet. It was too early for the Yanaka Ginza stores so I made a detour to Nippori. I got ushered/roped into doing a fire prevention training hosted by the Tokyo Fire Department right outside the station and participated in a number of activities like fire extinguisher usage, crawling through a smoke-filled tent, calling the emergency line, bandaging wounds, etc. It was pretty hilarious and fun and I received stickers and a bath bomb for finishing everything. Afterwards, I went back to Yanaka Ginza. There are all lot of small restaurants, grocery stores, coffee shops, and places selling trinkets here. After an early ramen lunch, I walked from Yanaka Ginza to Sendagi, through Nezu, and back down to Ueno. It's definitely a lot quieter and removed from the bustling touristy areas. In my view, there wasn't anything notable but there were a lot of restaurants. It's a healthy walk, though. I went to Kintar≈ç Sushi for a second lunch and filled my belly up with a sushi box and chirashi bowl. Unfortunately I felt a bit under the weather after sushi. I thought I had caught covid or something and went back to my hotel to take a nap. I felt much better afterward, and stayed in Ueno for dinner. **Day Four (Wed) - Shibuya** * Yoyogi Park * Shibuya (west of Crossing) * Nintendo World/Pokemon Center Started off my day by Yoyogi Park by grabbing some pastries for breakfast at 365 Days. It‚Äôs a small, cute store with an impressive selection of sweet and savory pastries. I circled the park and made my way down to Shibuya to the Nintendo World/Pokemon Center in the Parco. Yoyogi Park is a spacious area with a huge field for dogs but I think Meiji Jingu next door is a lot more beautiful and suited for travelers. I didn‚Äôt get a chance to explore this side of the Crossing the last time I was in Tokyo, so it was nice to see the different stores and malls. It felt like a true downtown shopping district from an American city. Unfortunately, my eye was acting up (it was for the past couple weeks). I thought I had a tear in my retina. Thankfully, the Kato Eye Clinic by Shibuya Crossing accepts walk-in appointments so I was able to get seen. It was about 9000 or 10000 yen for a full exam. The ophthalmologist was wonderful and she spoke English (there is a language barrier with the staff). I got seen and there were no issues detected which was relieving. My eye was dilated which cut my day short but I was able to take the train back to my hotel. I had an unagi set meal for the first time at Unatoto Unagi. It was very rich and filling and I‚Äôm glad to have tried it but it is a one and done thing for me. **Day Five (Thurs) - Daikanyama, Ikebukuro** * Starbucks Roastery * Ikebukuro Chinatown * Sunshine City/Pokemon Center My plan was to originally visit the Starbucks Roastery and then Shibuya the previous day but I wasn't able to given my eye situation. This became a make-up day. I went to Okayama Denim in the morning, browsed some stores in the area, and then headed to Starbucks Roastery. I picked up some gifts for my family and had a nice cup of coffee and chocolate cake. My only complaint was this area is a bit difficult to access by train so some walking is definitely necessary but the area felt hip and high end. After going to the Roastery, I took the train to Ikebukuro and walked through the different areas including Owl Street and Chinatown. This district seems a lot bigger than how it looks on the map and I hope to explore more of it the next time I return to Japan. Next, I went through the station to the other side and made my way to Sunshine City. Sunshine City was fun but overwhelmingly huge. I think it‚Äôs connected to an aquarium and an observatory too. There is a Pokemon Center here along with a large gachapon store. **Day Six (Friday) - Saitama** * The Railway Museum at Saitama * Hobby Center Kato As a train fan, I had to check out The Railway Museum at Saitama. This was probably one of the greatest museums I have ever visited. It‚Äôs huge, clean, and full of interactive exhibits. There is a huge room filled with preserved locomotives and rolling stock. There is even a mini track at the end of the museum where you can drive tiny versions of famous Japanese trains like the Yamanote line. You can easily spend half a day here and even a full day if you try all the interactive demos. Depending on where your lodging is, traveling to Saitama is actually kinda far (60+ minutes for me). But if you have time in your trip, I definitely recommend this museum. Afterwards, I went to Hobby Center Kato, a model train store. This place is packed with model trains, parts, and structures‚Äîa model train enthusiast‚Äôs paradise! For dinner, I had some crazy good Chinese food at ÁæäË≤¥Â¶ÉÁæäÊπØÈ§® Âæ°ÂæíÁî∫. The lamb soup and skewers were perfect for keeping me warm on a cold and rainy day. **Day Seven (Saturday) - Harajuku** * Harajuku/Cat Street * Omotesando I always enjoy Harajuku and Cat Street. It‚Äôs just a fun place to explore especially if you‚Äôre into Japanese denim - Studio d‚Äôartisan, Pure Blue Japan, Momotaro, etc. you can find the whole gamut in Harajuku. I walked around Tokyu Plaza Omotesando Omokado but I‚Äôll need to come back in the future to explore more. It‚Äôs extremely crowded but lively. I went to Ometesando Hills next - it‚Äôs all boutique shopping which isn‚Äôt my thing but the architectural layout of the mall is spectacular. I checked out the streets behind Ometesando Hills and went to another ‚Äúviral‚Äù coffee shop, Higuma Doughnuts √ó Coffee Wrights Omotesando. I got the limoncello donut, chocolate donut, and the coffee of the day. It was good but social media overhyped this place. Checked out more stores including the Sugi Bee, Flying Tiger, and Herz. Capped off the night with a monster steak and hamburger patty at Monster Grill and drinks at 2nd Cooper. **Day Eight (Sunday) - Akihabara** * Akihabara * Kanda Myoujin Shrine * Yushima Seido * Hijiri Bridge Started my day off at Egg Baby Cafe when it opened. The egg sandwich was good but the fries were lukewarm which was disappointing. Maybe I‚Äôm just stupid but when the store opened, everyone rushed to save a table with their backpacks, jackets, umbrellas, etc. I was one of the first group of people to order at the counter but wasn‚Äôt able to find a seat because every table was saved by the people who didn‚Äôt even order yet! It really ticked me off. Went to Kanda Myoujin Shrine which was bustling and beautiful. There was also a wedding going on which was cool to see. Another nice attraction is Yushima Seido which is very close by. I crossed Hijiri Bridge which offers a magnificent view of the river and the Akihabara skyline. Walked past the river and around back to Akihabara. I specifically chose Sunday because the streets were closed to traffic. It‚Äôs really cool to see such a wide stretch of road blocked off and seeing people enjoy the entire street. However, it‚Äôs a nightmare browsing the stores due to the sheer number of people. After a nap at the hotel, I went back to Nippori to look at the Edwin denim store. **Day Nine (Monday) - Ueno** Rest day. For dinner, I want to highlight Niku no Ohyama, an izakaya/steakhouse with delicious meats and fried food. I ordered a Hoppy, not knowing you are supposed to mix it with a stronger beverage. I felt like I was just drinking carbonated water. You live and learn I guess. I also had my first coffee jelly dessert at Cafe Galant. **Day 10 (Tues) - Kanda** * Ozeki Gallery * Koami Shrine * Kanda Station/Manseibashi Station Remains * Kotobuki Yu Started my day at the Ozeki Gallery to purchase a tiny light lantern thingy I saw on Youtube. The gallery has a couple floors of lanterns/lights crafted by different artists to enjoy. Next, i went to the Koami Shrine. It‚Äôs really tiny but the line to touch the Buddha/pray was really long so I continued on my journey.. The Kanda area feels like a financial/business hub. I wanted to explore more but I think I was getting a little fatigued by this point in my trip so I mainly just kept walking. I went past Kanda Station, then past the Manseibashi Station Remains and finally back to my hotel for a break. I hope to explore the Jimbocho area next time! I went to my first public bath at Kotobuki Yu which was a very good experience but I was very shy. I was honestly very confused on what to do (but I made sure to shower myself thoroughly beforehand and didn‚Äôt dip my face into the pools). Honestly, I felt super stupid at the changing room because I didn‚Äôt know how to operate the coin locker until I asked some older gentleman how lol. I tried out the different hot/cold pools and sat in the sauna which was crazy hot. I‚Äôll definitely do it again now that I have a little more confidence. **Day 11 (Wed) - Kamakura, Hase** * Yuigahama Beach * Hasedera * Kotoku-in * Komachi Street * Tsurugaoka Hachimangu I almost skipped out on Kamakura and I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt. This was my favorite part of my trip. I love big cities but it‚Äôs nice having a break from it. I took the train to Kamakura Station and walked to Yuigahama Beach then to Hase. It was another rainy day so there was practically no one at the beach. It was an empowering feeling knowing that I had made it to the coast of another country. I walked on the beach just to check out the waves. Hasadera is a beautiful temple complex with a lush, diverse garden. It was one of my favorite places and I highly recommend it. It also has a great view of the surrounding town when you climb up the steps at the complex. I then walked to Kotoku-in, the famous giant Buddha. It‚Äôs actually smaller than what photos make it out to be. There wasn‚Äôt a lot to do in the complex other than see the Buddha but you can enter the structure after paying a very modest fee. I went back to Hase Station and jumped on the vintage Enoden train back to Kamakura Station. I walked along Komachi Street which is filled with street food vendors and enjoyed some fish cake and curry pastries. I got to Tsurugaoka Hachimangu, another large temple complex (supposedly the most famous shrine in Kamakura?). There is a bit of a climb up the steps to the main hall of the temple! I liked Hasadera more but to each his own I suppose. I walked all the way back to Kamakura Station and took the train back to my hotel. It was a long day and I was exhausted from all the walking. Nothing special, but I went to Bar Luke in Ameyoko for a few drinks. I noticed the drink menu was entirely in Japanese which almost made me leave in a panic but I decided to just use Google Lens to translate. The bartender was cool and the drinks were delicious so it ended up being a good night! **Day 12 (Thurs) - Chiyoda area** * Tokyo Dome City * Tokyo Station/Character Street I went to get a head massage at Mr. Head at the Ichigaya area in the morning. This was my second time at the store and it's honestly such a fun and relaxing experience. As a baseball fan, I had to visit Tokyo Dome. Unfortunately, my trip ended right before the Los Angeles Dodgers played the Chicago Cubs. Otherwise, I would have stayed and went to a game. I also made it a goal to explore Tokyo Station fully after being overwhelmed last time. I took my time exploring the shopping areas and went to the third floor. I picked up some toys at the Tomica shop. The Tokyo Gift Palette on the first floor is this huge shop filled with souvenirs, snacks, and sweets. It's a great place to look for little trinkets and snacks for your friends and family. The area isn‚Äôt as daunting as I feared it would be as long as you don‚Äôt let the crowds overwhelm you. **Day 13 (Friday) - Haneda -&gt; fly home** No highlights but I went to get breakfast at ≈åj≈ç in Ameyoko and ordered their thick toast and it was the thickest piece of toast I had ever seen in my life. **Lessons Learned** 1. Viral stuff isn‚Äôt significantly better (it‚Äôs about the same as other places). My sister sent me an Instagram post of ‚Äúpopular‚Äù coffee shops for me to try and I went to half of them. While I didn‚Äôt experience any significant lines, these coffee shops tasted like any other coffee shop. I can‚Äôt imagine doing the same thing for restaurants and having to wait 60+ minutes for food constantly. 2. Hotel location. I didn‚Äôt encounter this issue last time because my activities were spread out but I quickly realized that strategic hotel booking is important to minimize on commute time. My hotel was in Ueno but most of the places I visited were in the western/southern side of the city (Shibuya, Kichijogi, Daikanyama, Kamakura, etc) which took longer to get to. While it‚Äôs not *huge* deal, i think it‚Äôs important to cut down on travel time as much as possible. 3. I was very underdressed and unprepared for the weather. It was 35-45 degrees and raining heavily most of the time I was in Japan and I did not have enough warm clothes (even with all my layers on). Unfortunately, I‚Äôm a pretty thick dude (XXL-3XL in US sizes) so clothes shopping was out of the question and I didn‚Äôt feel like making a detour to Sakazen. I don‚Äôt have much experience in colder temps so next time I‚Äôll know to bring warmer gear. **Brief Thoughts on Solo Travel** Solo travel isn't for everyone. In my case, I had an amazing time. It's liberating and freeing going about things at my own pace, seeing the things I want to see, and doing the things I want to do. You also avoid the hassle of trying to coordinate activities and schedules with others. I feel like Tokyo is a perfect place for solo travel since a lot of the restaurants can be enjoyed alone. I did feel lonely sometimes as I didn't have anyone to converse with regarding the sights or food. I also felt like I had to be more active in planning for activities if I got through my itinerary early. However, the pros definitely outweighed the cons for me. **Conclusion** Overall, I had an excellent solo trip and enjoyed myself. Thank you to everyone in this sub for providing their trip reports, suggestions, and feedback. I hope to go to Japan again next January!"}

This is my 5th trip to Japan, and this time I chose to go Yamaguchi. Just wanted to share my experience because of how much fun I had. If you're a traveler who likes the bustling and crowd of Tokyo and Osaka, Yamaguchi would definitely not be for you. There's really absolutely nothing there if you are more keen on nightlife, shopping and activities. But if you're someone who's really interested in the culture, history and geography of Yamaguchi. Why not put Yamaguchi as your next stop? The well known Motonosumi Shrine was such a beautiful experience, with the sea breeze and the torii gates, as your head to the edge, you get to witness the duo colour of the sea below your feet as well as wild flowers blooming on the side of the mountain. Akiyoshido Cave was so magnificently gorgeous that it felt unreal, as you head out to the entrance, or the exit depending on the way you enter, The way the outside world appeared to you through a crack with the scenery of foliage, and as you step outside, the beautiful turquoise water, walkway and trees. It felt unreal. Hagi, a beautiful samurai town that offers a shopping street that has white castle walls as you walk down, and you get to witness the old samurai houses. As you continue walking on, you arrive at a beautiful beach and a castle ruin. There is a really big old building there right by the tourist centre that you would have to wear slippers indoors, and I thought I've seen old buildings at Meiji Mura Museum, Inuyama. But this looked way older. You can really feel the history of the place. To get there, you can enjoy taking a bus from Yamaguchi and watch as the bus cut through mountains and take scenic paths to reach Hagi. Tsuwano (Not really Yamaguchi at this point, it's Shimane) There is a special train called SL Yamaguchi, it's a Steam Locomotive that goes to Tsuwano from Shin-Yamaguchi during weekends! And vice versa. The train runs on coal and you get to enjoy a scenic ride, while the locals and train enthusiasts on the street will wave to you as you pass by. You will reach a peaceful town that has many koi fish running through the shopping streets river, alongside with flowers blooming. Take a short hike, you would be greeted by torii gates high above the town as you peek in between the torii to catch a glimpse of the city. That is the Taikodani Inari-jinja Shrine. Continuing on further more, you can take a chair lift or hike up to Tsuwano Castle Ruins. There's nothing there but a bench, and a impressive magnificient view of the whole area. There is something impressive about a bench alone, on top of the city and among the mountains. At Yuda Onsen, a town famous for its foot bath and white foxes, why not drop by to soak your feet? The tourist information centre offers a 200¬• charge for you to soak your feet, indoors or outdoors whichever you prefer! The 2nd floor occasionally hold exhibitions too. LAWAKU, A wagashi shop at Yuda Onsen offers hands on wagashi making experiences as well. The best and saddest part of this all is, there isn't much people in Yamaguchi. It's a really quiet area. I wonder if it's off peak season now that it's so quiet. Even the tourist hotspots, there are people but it's in small numbers. It really brought back what it felt like to travel, instead of being in a beautiful place but squeezing to even walk. You can breathe, take in the scenery, have the place to yourself. I really enjoyed my time in Yamaguchi and felt that the scenery and food they had to offer is in nowhere lacking to the other Prefectures. That's the wonderful thing about Japan I appreciate a lot, every Prefecture has a beautiful place that doesn't lose out to each other at all. It's probably due to the declining population as well, but every vendor and owners I have chat with, they always responded with Â±±Âè£‰∫∫Â∞ë„Å™„ÅÑ„Å†„Åã„Çâ aka there isn't enough people in Yamaguchi. It feels like there's a tinge form of sadness behind every conversation we have about the peacefulness of Yamaguchi. I really enjoyed my time in Yamaguchi and think it's a place not a lot of people go to, heck. The one week I was there, the hotel I stayed in was mostly just Japanese salarymen coming to and forth, there were way more local tourists than international tourists. It's to the point that I actually get excited to see a foreigner like myself when I'm there. It would be nice if this post makes you even just slightly interested to drop by Yamaguchi if given a chance."}

We did the golden triangle (Tokyo &gt; Kyoto &gt; Osaka), with the addition of Hiroshima/Miyajima, and a quick return to Tokyo before leaving. I don't quite remember where I got the idea (probably this subreddit), but I know Japan often has a gift giving culture rather than tipping, and so I brought little pins shaped like Texas (my home state!) to give to people who helped us throughout our journey. Here's who they went to. 1. I believe the first pin was given to one of our first Taxi drivers, Masayoshi-san. I cautiously started off with a \"Ogenki desu ka?\" which received a \"Are you talking to me?!\", but the conversation evolved and we had a great time talking. He apparently had owned his own sushi restaurant for over 20 years until he unfortunately had to shut it down due to Covid. But he reassured us that he loved being a taxi driver, and it shone through with his joy and friendliness. Upon hearing I was a nurse, he asked me if I was rich, and then said Japanese people don't have enough money to go to Hakone. I cautiously set a pin on the little tray on his center console, and he accepted it graciously. I had been studying Japanese in preparation for this trip, and wasn't sure how much it would actually help. Masayoshi was a test of my skills, and it proved very useful! 2. Thanks to a friend, we had tickets to see a pair of JPop/JRock bands in Shimokitazawa, and both of them were stupendous. I wanted us to get there early so we could get \"good spots,\" but the venue is so small that anywhere you stand you have a good view of the stage and performers. For the second group, the bassist was a woman with great style who absolutely rocked. We went to line up for merch and I didn't realize for these so-called \"smaller\" bands, the members themselves peddled their own wares. I told her it was my first show, that I loved it, and gave her a pin. She put it on then and there. 3. We had made our way to a random udon shop, I think the tendon place I had wanted to go to had too long of a line. No matter, I remember seeing the sign displaying silky bukkake udon to be incredibly appetizing, and was excited for what was to come. While we were talking, I heard the little boy to our left ask his mom and grandma \"A-, eigo?\" I mustered up some courage, turned to them, and said \"if it's okay, would he like one of these?\" After some \"yokatta\"s, and \"ii ne!\", I saw him staring at the pin, holding it with both hands, and then utter \"kakkoii...\" 4. In Hakone, we originally booked a sort of hotel set up with an attached hot spring facility, but I decided to pivot to a more traditional ryokan that was closer to the station. Yaeikan ended up being a nice, quaint experience‚Äîperfect to return to after a harrowing bus ride. It was small enough that they knew us by the name of the room we were staying in, and we were attended to by a sweet woman who served us breakfast/dinner and an (what seemed to me) incredibly elderly man who set out our futons at night. I tried not to give pins to people just doing their jobs, but in our brief conversations you could tell she loved what she did. She put my pin on right away. 5. I believe we were in Nara, and looking over my pictures I realize that we followed a similar path as two Chinese tourists. We eventually ended up at a temple at the top of a hill, which aren't exactly uncommon. What was uncommon was how they revealed their fortunes, you bought it as a blank page, and they had blocks of ice you placed it upon, which revealed your fortune. One of these tourists was kind enough to show us how it worked, and was rewarded with a pin (which she may have thrown away at the next opportunity, who knows). 6. Once in Nara, we had the opportunity to meet up with a pal's old college friend. We set off for Nara park, and had a blast watching tourists (and each other) get chased by deer. Her boyfriend seemed kind of interested, so I bought a pack of crackers, hid them under my shirt until I shoved them into his hands as a surprise, and ran away. The resulting swarming was worth the 200 yen. We spent a lot of time dragging them around, from squeezing through a tiny hole at Toudaiji (I made it!), to waiting some time to see a (middling) mochi pounding show. I gave them both pins. 7. I was rushing through the train station and upon rounding a corner we heard wailing. A little boy apparently didn't want to leave, or maybe they had never wanted to come. I quickly retrieved a pin and brought it over, hoping new shiny thing would calm them down. We heard a brief lull, accompianed by \"isn't that great!\", before the wailing started up again as we left earshot. 8. On our last day, I was walking back from breakfast and passed by an unassuming liquor store right around the corner from our apartment. I poked my head in‚Äîit was half liquor store half person's office. Bottles filled the shelves, but it wasn't particularly well lit, and at the far end was a desk covered in paperwork and receipts. The place was lived in. I tried to explain in broken Japanese that I was looking for umeshu, plum wine, to bring back to a friend in the states. He brought me to their selection and recommended one of them. I paid, it was 1750 yen (barely 12 USD), but regretted not carrying my bag with me to give him a pin. Our place was around the corner though, so I ran over, grabbed my bag, and came back to an empty store. I yelled out \"sumimasen!\", and a younger fellow replied \"hai!\" and came on down the stairs. I tried to explain that I wanted to show my appreciation, first by calling them \"ano hito\" (that person), which received a quizzical look (\"dare?\"), before settling on \"oji-san\" (being careful not to say \"ojii-san\") which received an \"ah! My father.\" I presented the pin with both hands and insisted he take it. I was too busy shyly escaping to see his reaction. I really appreciated bringing the pins, I think it encouraged me to go out of my way to interact with locals and try for connection. There were plenty of times where I lamented the fact like I didn't have my bag, like at the Agata festival where we all shook this curious toddler's hand while walking through the crowds. Try it out next time you go to Japan!"}

I was inspired by the trip reports posted here and decided why not try my hand at writing one up myself. After I finished I realized this might be a bit lengthy‚Ä¶ # Trip Report Below is the outline and then some commentary for each day. # Days 1 &amp; 2 - Arrival in Osaka **Afternoon** * Arrive at Osaka KIX from Toronto YYZ * Hotel: HOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi **Evening** * Shinsaibashi-suji Shopping Street * Dinner: Yakiniku Like (Japanese BBQ) Left Toronto YYZ just after 1 pm. I don‚Äôt sleep on airplanes. This means I drink a lot of coffee and keep myself entertained with the airplane wifi. I find that time passes quickly online when I‚Äôm reading the news and chatting with friends so the wifi is well worth the splurge for me. I flew Air Canada and complimentary wifi is currently only available on flights within North America. Air Canada long haul international flights won‚Äôt have complimentary wifi until 2026. After the 14-hour flight, I arrived at Osaka KIX just after 4 pm. Cleared customs and since I brought one checked bag I headed to the luggage carousel. Pleasantly surprised by how quickly the line moved at customs as last year at Narita it took over an hour. The time it took for me to clear customs and get my luggage at the carousel was 25 minutes. I did have priority so that helped when deplaning and picking up my luggage. I bought a ticket for the Nankai Limited Express at the ticket counter to Namba Station. From Namba Station I switched to the local train to get to Shinaisaibashi Station. The trip from airport to hotel took about 75 minutes. I checked in at HOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi. This hotel was mentioned by several people on this subreddit in past threads asking for hotel recommendations in Osaka. I stayed in the Namba area during my previous visits (and it was great) and wanted to try somewhere new this time. I had dinner at Yakiniku Like for some cheap Japanese BBQ. It is what you'd expect - it was cheap, fast, and satisfying. After dinner I went to Shinsaibashi-suji Shopping Street and the Uniqlo there to browse as the store close to my hotel had Osaka exclusive merch. While it was neat to look through, I didn't end up buying any of it though. And my goodness the number of people crammed onto the shopping street is wild lol, like holy moly! More than what I remember the last time I was in Osaka in 2023. # Day 3 - Osaka **Morning** * Shin-Osaka Station (pick up JR regional pass) * Umeda Sky Building Lunch: IZUMO Unagi (eel bowl) **Afternoon** * Nintendo Osaka * Pok√©mon Centre Osaka * Tenjinbashi-suji Shopping Street * Osaka Castle **Evening** * Dinner: Tempura Makino Namba * Shinsaibashi-suji Shopping Street I went to the Shin-Osaka Station JR ticket office to pick up my JR Setouchi Area Pass. Prior to my trip I purchased the regional pass on the JR West Company website and made all my seat reservations online. At the station I picked up my regional pass and all of my seat tickets for my trips from the agent. After picking up my regional pass I made the short walk over to the Umeda Sky Building and bought a ticket to check out the day time view. Since I went at opening there were a handful of other people, not crowded at all. I‚Äôd imagine it gets crowded in the evenings. Once I was done at Umeda Sky Building, it was another short walk for lunch at IZUMO Unagi for an eel bowl. I ordered the unagi tamago don. It was suuuper filling for me so I had a lot of leftover rice after I finished the eel and egg. It was nice that they use the leftover rice to form a rice ball for you to take take away. It is important to note that the shop was cashless so you either pay by IC card or by credit card. After lunch I walked to Umeda Station to visit the Nintendo Store to see if they had any cool Nintendo Switch 2 accessories. Aside from some accessories I didn‚Äôt see anything noteworthy. I dropped by the Pok√©mon Centre Osaka to check out the merch selection. I‚Äôm not looking for anything in particular but I enjoy the nostalgia every time I visit so I make the time to pop into the stores whenever one is close by. After the Pok√©mon Centre I took the train to the Tenjinbashi-suji Shopping Street. I walked the entire length of this street. It was crowded but it‚Äôs not shoulder to shoulder like the shopping streets in the Shinsaibashi and Namba areas. Afterwards I went to Osaka Castle. I‚Äôve been inside the castle before so this time I decided not to buy a ticket and stayed outside instead. It was pretty sunny and hot so many people were sitting in the shade and resting by the vending machine area outside the castle. I took the train back to the Namba area and had dinner at Tempura Makino Namba. The family next to me had a lot of leftovers, they didn‚Äôt even touch their pumpkin tempura (my personal favourite)! It was kind of crazy how much food was wasted to be honest. Even locals who were waiting to be seated commented on the waste. After dinner I capped off the night with another stroll down Shinsaibashi-suji Shopping Street. # Day 4 - Uji &amp; Nara **Morning** * Travel to Uji * Byodoin Temple &amp; Museum * Lunch: Nakamura Tokichi Honten (main store) (matcha buckwheat noodles) * Byodoin Omotesando Shopping Street **Afternoon** * Travel to Nara * Nara Park * Todaiji (outside) * Kasugataisha Shrine **Evening** * Sanjo Dori Shopping Street * Dinner: Kamaiki (udon) * Travel back to Osaka This was my first time visiting Uji and my second time in Nara. I took an early train just before 7 am to Uji. The trip was about 80 minutes from my hotel to Uji Station. From the station I walked to the Byodoin Temple which opens at 8:30 am. Since I was there at opening I got to do two loops around the grounds before the crowds started arriving. The ticket also included the museum so I got to check that out with a handful of other visitors as well. I did not purchase an additional ticket for the Phoenix Hall inside the grounds as it didn‚Äôt open until later in the morning when I have other plans. At 9:40 am I headed over to Nakamura Tokichi Honten (main store location) for an early lunch as they open at 10 am. I took a number to queue and also queued up for their store for fun since I wouldn‚Äôt immediately be able to get into the cafe anyway. By the time I entered the store (5 minutes after opening), all the matcha sold out lol. So if you‚Äôre looking to buy matcha from their stores, be sure to start queuing waaay before I did. I didn‚Äôt have to wait long for my number to be called for the cafe. For lunch I had their cold matcha buckwheat noodles, matcha jelly, and an iced matcha drink. Relative to the average cost of a meal in Japan, it was a bit pricier with the total coming in to just under ¬•3,000 but it was good. After lunch I walked down the Byodoin Omotesando Shopping Street to pick up some matcha from the smaller shops and other souvenirs. Some of the shops had limits on the number of matcha items customers can buy. It was another hot sunny day today so interestingly I didn't see crowds on the streets. After walking back and forth on the shopping street a bit I headed back to Uji Station and took the train to Nara. The trip was about 75 minutes from station to station. From the station I walked to Nara Park. The last time I was here I bought the deer crackers and fed the deer so this time I opted to just observe others. There were a ton of people on the sidewalks and at the park. From Nara Park I walked to Todai-Ji (didn‚Äôt go inside this time to see the Buddha this time) and instead explored the east side on my way to the Kasugataisha Shrine. I stopped by Nakatanidou and bought some mochi. I had their mochi the last time I was in Nara and made sure to get some again. Perhaps I was starving at this point but the mochi was so good, more delicious than I remembered. As expected, the shop was crowded and was very popular. A lot of tourists asked about the mochi pounding but the staff pointed to a sign that indicated that the mochi pounding was over for the day. Not sure if they have a soft schedule (ie. done in the mornings) but something to note if this is something you want to see. I continued down Sanjo Dori Shopping Street and had dinner at Kamaiki. I arrived at the store 15 minutes before opening and there was a queue. However all of us were able to comfortably get seated inside with seats to spare. I ordered their shrimp tempura and udon. After dinner I walked back to the station and took the train back to Osaka. # Day 5 - Himeji &amp; Kobe **Morning** * Travel to Himeji * Himeji Castle * Travel to Kobe **Afternoon** * Lunch: Royal Mouriya (Kobe beef) * Nunobiki Herb Garden * Kobe Motomachi Shotengai * Kobe Chinatown Nankinmachi **Evening** * Dinner: Roshoki (Chinese dumplings) * Travel back to Osaka This was my first time visiting Himeji and Kobe. I took the 7:40 am Shinkansen (with a reserved seat) from Shin-Osaka Station to Himeji Station. Since I got to Himeji before the 9 am open time at Himeji Castle, I took my time and walked to the castle from the station which took me about 20 minutes. I didn‚Äôt plan on visiting the Koko-en Garden so I purchased a ticket just for Himeji Castle. Being able to walk through the castle was a really neat experience since we had to remove our shoes. I have to say, as someone who‚Äôs not afraid of heights, the steepness of the staircases was really something lol. Since I was there at opening I got to take my time through the castle before the crowds which was really nice. I can't imagine having to navigate those staircases along with the crowds. After the castle I walked back to Himeji Station and took the Shinkansen to Shin-Kobe Station. I rode without a reservation since the ride was only 15 minutes long. I had lunch at Royal Mouriya. I didn‚Äôt feel like splurging on the \"really fancy beef\" this time and so I ordered the rump steak. Relative to the average cost of a typical meal, it was still a splurge though at ¬•9,000. I thought it was good; it wasn't bad but it wouldn't knock your socks off. So maybe I should have splurged after all! :') After lunch I bought a round trip ticket for the Nunobiki Herb Garden. It‚Äôs been raining in the area (and in Himeji) on and off all day and at this point it‚Äôs fully raining. The top station at the garden had umbrellas for visitors to borrow and we would return them to the stand at the middle station, which was nice. No crowd at the garden, probably because it was raining pretty steadily. It was neat to see the different routes you take on your way down the garden depending on what you wanted to see (ie. lavender, vegetables, etc). I just went with the traditional route that took you through the lavender. It was still a beautiful place to explore in the rain. After the garden I headed to the Kobe Motomachi Shotengai to stay out of the rain. It was the typical shopping street with little stores. After an hour or two I made my way to the Kobe Chinatown Nankinmachi and had some Chinese dumplings at Roshoki for dinner. Roshoki was another place mentioned here (I think it was in a thread asking for non-Kobe beef related food recommendations). I have to say the dumplings were delicious and it's no wonder there is a long line up from tourists and locals alike. There's no place to sit to dine-in, so you either stand around and eat or you take your food with you to somewhere else. It was raining when I got my order but fortunately I had space under the awning in front of the shop so I was able to eat without getting rained on. The shop was across from the location I see in Google Maps so I think they moved, or it's just a temporarily relocation. Due to the rain I decided to head back to Osaka to chill around the hotel. I had originally planned to walk to Kobe Harborland Umie Mosaic to check the mall out and to go up the Kobe Port Tower for the evening view. I took the train back to Shin-Kobe Station and then took the Shinkansen back to Osaka, once again unreserved since the ride was only 15 minutes. # Day 6 - Osaka World Expo 2025 Below is a summary of a brief trip report I posted to the r/OsakaWorldExpo sub last week. **Summary of my day** * 7:55 am ‚Äî arrived at east gate (with 9 am entry time) * 9:05 am ‚Äî cleared security and scanned into the expo grounds * 9:10 am ‚Äî Germany Pavilion (walk-in) * &lt;gift shop&gt; * 10:10 am ‚Äî EARTH MART Signature Pavilion * &lt;lunch at GF Ramen Lab&gt; * 11:50 am ‚Äî DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM OF LIFE Signature Pavilion * 12:30 pm ‚Äî Japan Pavilion * &lt;walk around, ate more food&gt; * 5:05 pm ‚Äî left the expo This was my first time attending a world expo event. I knew about the mixed reviews and went anyway because I wasn't sure I would get another opportunity to attend one of these later on. Even an hour before opening the crowd waiting was huge. The security check to go in required you to have to walk through a metal detector, have your bag scanned, and they also check your bottled drinks. Of the four pavilions I went to, three were the ones I really wanted to see so I was satisfied with my day. My favourite one was Earth Mart. I felt it did a great job laying out everything in bite sized pieces while still being engaging. And the grand ring was superb. It was nice to be able to walk under it and on top of it all the way around the venue. Having said that, would I go back to the Osaka world expo if I had a second free day? Nope! This was more of a checkbox type of activity and I got to check it off. And holy queues! Lines, lines everywhere !! Pavilions? Lines! Family Mart? Lines! Washroom? Lines! Gift shops? Lines! It's like Disney... but worse! # Day 7 - Kyoto **Morning** * Travel to Kyoto * Nijo Castle * Lunch: Gion Duck Noodles (dipping noodles) **Afternoon** * Pok√©mon Centre Kyoto * Nishiki Market * Yasaka Shrine * Kiyomizu-dera **Evening** * Fushimi Inari Shrine * Travel back to Osaka This was my second time visiting Kyoto. I took an early train at around 7 am to Nijojo-Mae Station. The trip was about an 85 minutes from the hotel to the station. From the station I walked to Nijo Castle, which opened at 8:45 am. Again, since I was there at opening there were no crowds yet, just a few handfuls of visitors. This allowed me to have the time to read the displays without feeling like I need to keep moving because I was blocking others. After the castle I went to Gion Duck Noodles for some lunch. This was a cute little restaurant tucked away in an alleyway with nothing but a sign of a duck and a bowl. I was 30 minutes early, which was fine because I read online that lines here can be brutal. The staff were prepping inside the restaurant so I was just waited outside. I was first in line and within the next 20 minutes more people appeared and queued. While waiting the staff took the time to explain how the menu worked and took our orders. I ordered the dipping noodles with a mix of duck breast meat and thigh meat. I enjoyed it. After lunch I walked in the heat under the scorching sun to the Pok√©mon Centre Kyoto to check out the merch selection at this location. Didn't see anything I wanted to get; I was really close to getting that goofy looking Bidoof plush though. Quickly made my way to Nishiki Market and as expected, it was crowded with us tourists. Spent some time looking through the stores and had some matcha ice cream to cool off. The weather app said today felt like 40C-45C, whew. From the market I walked to Yasaka Shrine and then naturally made my way towards Kiyomizu-dera. As we all know, it's super crowded. I didn't mind since I expected to see other tourists and I wasn't in a hurry or anything. I noticed stores selling cold pickles on a stick. Not sure if I missed this the first time I visited Kyoto pre-covid or if this food item is a recent development. With the heat I was tempted.. but ultimately didn't get one myself. It did seem popular with other tourists though. After Kiyomizu-dera I took the train to Inari Station and walked to the Fushimi Inari Shrine. It wasn't as crowded as I expected, perhaps because it was late afternoon. The sun hadn't set yet and I didn't feel like waiting around 1-2 hours so I only went up halfway. The last time I was here I did the full hike in the morning. I didn't feel like eating out for dinner and just wanted to chill at the hotel so I took the train back to Osaka and got some snacks from 7-eleven. # Day 8 - Hiroshima &amp; Miyajima **Morning** * Travel to Hiroshima * Ferry to Miyajima * Itsukushima Shrine * Mount Misen * Miyajima Omotesando Shopping Street **Afternoon** * Ferry back to Hiroshima * Hiroshima Castle * Atomic Bomb Dome * Peace Memorial Park * Hiroshima Peace Museum **Evening** * Hotel: THE KNOT Hiroshima * Dinner: Hassei (Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki) This was my first time visiting Hiroshima and Miyajima. I took the 6:25 am Shinkansen to Hiroshima Station with a reserved seat. Perhaps I missed it but the bento shops I came across (after getting off from the Midosuji Line) at Shin-Osaka Station were not opened yet (ie. open at 6:30 am) which surprised me as I had planned on grabbing an ekiben to have on the train. Instead I had some leftover chocolate bread from 7-eleven I had brought with me. The trip was about 90 minutes from station to station. Once at Hiroshima Station I took a 30 minute train ride to Miyajimaguchi Station and then hopped on the JR Miyajima Ferry to Miyajima. At this ferry port there are two companies that operate ferries to and from the island. Since I had the JR Setouchi Area Pass, I took the ferry operated by JR as it was covered. One thing to note is that all visitors need to pay the visitor tax of ¬•100 which can be done by buying a ticket at the machines and you just hand your ticket over to the gate staff. There was already a sizeable group of people waiting for the ferry. Once I got to Miyajima I left my overnight bag in a coin locker and strolled through Miyajima Omotesando Shopping Street towards the Itsukushima Shrine. It was still a bit early (just before 9 am), so most shops on the street weren't opened yet. After the shrine I made my way to towards the Miyajima Ropeway. It was not crowded at all on the walk up as I saw only two other people on the way. I bought a round trip ticket and took the ropeway up to the observatory on Mount Misen. There was no breeze at all so it was very stuffy inside on the way up and there were only two of us lol. I can't imagine what it would be like at capacity with eight people! At the observatory I made the the decision to do the 30-minute hike up to the summit of Mount Misen. I figured, 30 minutes wasn't so bad... But it as another hot day and doing the hike in 37C-39C weather was kind of brutal. About 5 minutes in I honestly wanted to turn around but glad I didn't because the view at the summit was amazing. There was place for us to rest and enjoy the breeze. It was nice to see more and more people make it up to the top, some even hugged and congratulated each other. The way back down towards the observatory was kind of hard on the knees though, so watch out. After coming back down from Mount Misen, the stores were now opened on Miyajima Omotesando Shopping Street and there were waaay more people around. For lunch I had some snacks along the way - coffee ice cream, momiji manju, its fried variant age-momiji manju, and some grilled oysters. I went back to the ferry terminal, picked up my overnight bag from the coin lockers, and I took the ferry back to Hiroshima. I made my way to Hiroshima Castle. Perhaps it was the route I took but there was strangely no one on the streets except for a few locals. Even at the castle there were maybe only two handfuls of other tourists. I didn't go inside the castle and instead headed towards the Atomic Bomb Dome. Seeing it was kind of surreal because it made me realize that an atomic bomb once flattened this entire city. After the dome, I walked through the Peace Memorial Park and spent some time at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. The museum was a very somber experience. This was the first time I've been inside a museum where no one spoke, it was pin drop silent. We all just quietly shuffled from one display to another. While many of us learned about the bombing in school, seeing it from the perspective of ordinary citizens and the impact it had on them and their families was certainly a different experience. After the museum, it was a short walk to my hotel for the night - THE KNOT Hiroshima. Again, this hotel was suggested by a few people on this sub in the Hiroshima threads. After checking in I headed over to Hassei for dinner and had some Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki. As someone who does not like Osaka-style okonomiyaki (my friends gasp), I did enjoy this style a lot more. # Day 9 - Fukuoka **Morning** * Travel to Fukuoka * Daizaifu Tenmangu * Daizaifu Omotesando Shopping Street **Afternoon** * Lunch: ShinShin (ramen) * Canal City Hakata * Kushida Shrine **Evening** * Travel back to Osaka This was my first time visiting Fukuoka. I checked out of the hotel at 5:30 am. Since I had time and it was a low 22C, I decided to walk the 35 minutes to Hiroshima Station instead of taking the streetcar. At the station I grabbed an ekiben (the shops were opened, yes!) and took the 6:43 am Shinkansen to Hakata Station with a reserved seat. The trip was about 75 minutes from station to station. Once at Hakata Station, I put my overnight bag inside a coin locker. I took the train to Daizaifu, about a 45 minute ride with multiple transfers. Similar to other days, since it was early (around 9 am) most stores on the Daizaifu Omotesando Shopping Street weren't opened yet. I strolled around the Dazaifu Tenmangu and it gradually got more and more crowded as the bus tours started arriving. After spending some time in the shrine, the stores were now opened on the shopping street so I had some umegae mochi while checking out some stores. From Daizaifu I took the train all the back to Hakata Station and went to ShinShin for some lunch, another recommendation on this app. Based on some comments I saw, I went to the PARCO location (located in the basement) so that I didn't have to queue outside in the heat and instead was able to line up in indoors which was nice. The wait wasn't long, only about 20 minutes as it moved quite quickly. I got their most basic bowl of ramen and it was fantastic. I bought a few boxes of their ramen to bring back to give out to friends. After lunch I went to Canal City Hakata. There honestly wasn't much here. For a mall it was not busy at all. If I were to change this part of my itinerary perhaps I would have gone to Tenjin Underground Mall instead. From there I walked to the Kushida Shrine which was a bit more crowded. I headed back to Hakata Station and took at look at the shops there but didn't buy anything. I picked up my overnight bag from the coin locker and took the shinkansen back to Osaka and the train ride was about 2 hours and 20 minutes. Interestingly, unlike in other cities like Osaka, Kyoto, Tokyo, or even Hiroshima, almost all tourists in Fukuoka I saw were Asian (from South Korea, China, Hong Kong, and such). # Day 10 - Universal Studios Japan This was my first time visiting USJ. I took an early train to USJ and arrived at the gates at 8 am. I had purchased the express pass (Express 7) to get guaranteed access to Super Nintendo World and its rides without having to fret about long queues and such. I arrived at the park early anyway because I wanted to ride the Hollywood Dream Backdrop ride and didn‚Äôt want to wait over an hour for it during the day. Once I got into the park I went straight to line up for the Hollywood backdrop ride. As someone who likes rollercoasters, I really liked this one! Going backwards really made it more thrilling. After the backdrop ride, I headed to Super Nintendo World as my entry time was 10:00 am. I started heading over there at 9:55 am and my oh my, the line up just get into SNW was loooong. It took about 15 minutes to get in, so if you're running behind just be sure to leave yourself a little bit of time to get in, especially if you have certain rides you need to be at by a certain time. * Mario Kart: Koopa‚Äôs Challenge - really enjoyed this ride, the mechanics made it super fun. * Yoshi‚Äôs Adventure - kid's ride, nothing too exciting for adults. * Mine Cart Madness - it was okay; personally I don't think it justified the long queues for people lining up without a pass. The express pass came with two rides where I chose between one or the other. I picked: * The Flying Dinosaur - with the way they had us hanging like cattle, it was a little bit uncomfortable during the twists and turns! They handed out elastic bands to riders with loose footwear (ie. crocs) to put on so they wouldn't fly off during the ride, never seen that before! * Jurassic Park - a nice way to cool off on a hot day. My area entry to Harry Potter was 5:30 pm. * Forbidden Journey - just as I remembered, always a fun one. * Flight of the Hippogriff - another kid's ride, nothing too exciting for adults. Park food I ate during the day: * Green shell calzone with yakisoba - pretty decent actually. * Turkey leg - probably the worst turkey leg I have eaten at an amusement park (I've had the ones at Disney). If I could go back in time I would have tried the smoked chicken leg instead. * Butter beer (frozen) - as good as I remembered and a great way to cool off. I honestly don‚Äôt know how parents do it at theme parks like USJ and DisneySea (where I went last year). Dealing with the crowds, the constant app refreshing to ensure you get time entries and tickets to the rides‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all fine as a solo traveller but you guys do it with your kids in tow. Ya‚Äôll the MVPs lol. The cost for the Express Pass is steep, especially since you can only go on the rides once unlike in Orlando where a few years ago I kept going on that Spider-Man ride over and over via express lanes. But at the end of the day to me it was still worth the expense. Not having to spend hours and hours queuing up allowed me to spend the time taking in the park and just walk around. I was only at the park for one day and wanted to make the most of my time. And the regular lines were loooong this day. # Day 11 - Osaka **Morning** * Kuromon Ichiban Market * Lunch: Daiki-suisan Kaitenzushi Dotombori (conveyor belt sushi) **Afternoon** * Namba Ebisu Bashi-suji Shopping Street **Evening** * Dinner: Shabuwara Namba Grand Kagetsu (shabu shabu) The first of two laid back days I penciled into my itinerary. I got to Kuromon Ichiban Market just as stores were starting to open up. It's always interesting to see a place gradually get more and more lively over the course of an hour or so. I didn't end up buying anything at the market and made my way towards Daiki-suisan Kaitenzushi Dotombori (another user recommendation) for some conveyer belt sushi for lunch. I arrived before opening and waited outside. They had a seating area with a fan so that was nice. After lunch I started to do all the shopping I waited to do on this trip and headed to the Namba Ebisu Bashi-suji Shopping Street. It was suuuper crowded but that didn't bother me too much since I'm travelling on my own and didn't have to worry about getting separated from friends or family. Just a little patience when encountering the slow walkers! I dropped off my goods back at the hotel and headed back out for some dinner at Shabuwara Namba Grand Kagetsu. They have a choice of shabu shabu or sukiyaki and I chose shabu shabu. I enjoyed it. # Day 12 - Osaka **Morning** * Shitennoji Flea Market * Lunch: Gorichan Onigiri (rice balls) **Afternoon** * Nipponbashi Denden Town * Sennichimae Doguyasuji Shopping Street * Osaka Takashimaya **Evening** * Dinner: Ichiran (ramen) * Shinsaibashi-suji Shopping Street I went to the Shitennoji Flea Market which is opened on the 21st and 22nd of every month. Not too different from other flea markets you see around the world. There was a good mix of locals and tourists checking out the goods. I was very tempted to pick up a cheap umbrella for ¬•200 but held back. It was another hot day but I had a good time browsing what each vendor had to offer. Eventually I made my way back north to have lunch at Gorichan Onigiri. There was already a long line waiting by the time I arrived 15 minutes before the shop opening. There were two lines, one to dine-in and another for take-out. I waited about 40 minutes before I was seated and by that time some of their special onigiri (egg yolk with wagyu beef I think was one of them) were sold out, so definitely arrive earlier than I did if you want to try their special items. I ordered two - mustard leaf and fried chicken with mayo - and they were delicious. Also much larger than the onigiri found in the convenience stores. After lunch it was some exploring. I had forgotten how busy the character goods stores can get. Some of these stores were absolutely packed. Even though I'm no longer into anime and manga, it was still fun to browse and see what's popular these days. I'm the type of person who is perfectly content just to browse and see what stores have to offer. Picked up a few things here and here and headed back to the hotel to drop them off. I made sure to get some Press Butter Sand at the Takashimaya. The staff at the shop said the Uji matcha flavour was available in the Kansai region only so I got a few boxes of those. While planning my trip last year to Tokyo, Press Butter Sand was mentioned in a post asking for snack recommendations. I got the original flavour and that made me a believer so it was nice to finally have some again. After a bit of rest it was time for my last dinner in the city. It's a bit of a tradition for me to have Ichiran at least once whenever I‚Äôm in Japan. I know some people have their opinions (for and against) but personally I enjoy it. Though I have to say after my experience at ShinShin in Fukuoka, Ichiran was just 'great' and not 'great!!' like before. # Day 13 - Travel back to Toronto * Travel to Osaka KIX * Flight from Osaka KIX to Toronto YYZ I checked out by 11 am. Since it was sunny and hot I didn't feel like walking outside and taking the subway with my luggage. Instead I had the hotel call a taxi to take me to Namba Station. I got a ticket for the Nankai Limited Express and headed out to Osaka KIX. I'm the type to show up at the airport early \"just in case\" so I had to wait about 2 hours before the bag drop off for my flight opened. No worries though, I just used the time to get caught up on the news and my work emails while I waited. Since it was the weekend, the airport was super crowded and finding a seat was hard but fortunately I found one. Once I dropped off my bag and cleared security (yay for priority security!), it was some last minute shopping. The duty-free shop was extremely crowded and busy so I just skipped it entirely. I browsed the smaller stores by the gates and bought some more snacks. I had some money left over on my suica so I topped it up to the exact amount needed to buy a drink from the vending machine to use up the balance. There were still a few hours before my flight at 6 pm so I passed the time with food and drinks in the KIX Lounge Kansai upstairs by my gate. Once we boarded I splurged on wifi again and the 12.5 hour flight home was easy breezy. # Cost Breakdown (in Canadian Dollars) The chart below breaks down the total cost of my trip by category. I wasn't holding myself to a tight budget or anything but I wasn't looking to splurge at every opportunity. I went back and forth with myself when I was deciding whether to upgrade my seats on the flights because the cost was significant. Personally it was worth it for me because I was comfortable for the cumulative 26.5 hours I was in the air, I got to get off the plane first, got through customs first, and picked up my luggage first. I feel as I get older these things will become more important to me when I travel. Initially I did have aisle seats in economy so my fallback plan wasn't *too* bad! |Category|Amount (CAD)|Comments| |:-|:-|:-| |Airfare|$4,140|Direct flight round trip Toronto YYZ between Osaka KIX on Air Canada, booked in January 2025.

It was less common for JR regional passes to be brought up in these \"is it worth it?\" discussions. As mentioned above, I purchased this regional pass for CA$210 (¬•22,000). Below are the routes I took that were covered by the pass and what the cost would have been had I paid for the individual tickets.

Ubigi - the service I had was great 99% of the time. Though I do have to say I lost service on the train (above ground) from Kyoto to Osaka for about 30 minutes. It was sunny and wasn't cloudy so not sure what happened but it did happen, so FYI. I've used Airalo on previous trips to The Netherlands, US, and Japan and never had service drop. 2. For Canadians, the Wealthsimple Cash Card with no additional FX fee was great. Sadly I wasn't part of the beta test group for their no additional FX fee Visa card, but it would have been helpful! (at the time of this post I am still on their waitlist, grrr) 3. I used a mix of cash and credit card. While most placed accepted credit cards, a small subset did not have tap - such as Namba Station when I was purchasing a ticket from the agent for the Nankai Limited Express. So be prepared to insert your card and to use your PIN in these cases (or use cash). 4. If I needed cash, I withdrew from the ATMs at 7-eleven as they have no ATM withdrawal fee. Be sure to withdraw in JPY and not convert to your local currency. 5. Before travelling, download the offline Google maps of the cities you are visiting. It helps take the loud off the data a bit. # Final Thoughts Thank you to everyone on this subreddit, whether it's helping others with their itineraries or posting your own trip reports, I enjoy reading and learning from all of them. Many times I've found them very helpful when planning my own trips. And I like to live vicariously though others. This was my second solo trip to Japan. While I've been to Japan before with friends and family, I've found it so fulfilling to travel solo. To plan my own trips and decide for myself what I want to do and when I want to do it has given me a lot of satisfaction. Not sure when I'll be back in Japan but when I do return maybe I'll head north."}

We were in Japan for \\~2 weeks, with our kids (10 and 7). Before the trip: Flights and accommodations were booked in December/January for our June trip. I decided to go with Airbnbs for longer stays in Tokyo and Kyoto, and hotels for one-night stays in Nara and Universal Studios. As we built the itinerary (aka the massive Excel spreadsheet), the goal was to have lots of options and lots of flexibility. This worked out really well, and it was nice to not be locked into too many things, and to choose how active we wanted to be on any particular day. We could switch the days around as needed (ie move a day trip a day earlier or later than intended because of rain). We also had a list of things to possibly hit on each day of the itinerary - sights in the area, shops we were interested in, restaurants that looked good, etc. In March (\\~3 months before the trip), we started what we called \"Japan boot camp.\" Everyone got new sneakers, and we went for family walks of 2-3 miles 2-3 times per week. I HIGHLY recommend this, especially if you're going with little kids! Ours were able to handle 20-30k steps per day while we were over there, there's no way we would have seen as much as we did if we hadn't been sticking to a walking routine. In retrospect, I would add more stairs (iykyk). Also in March, we entered the lottery for tickets to the Nintendo museum. In April, we began booking activities. We won the Nintendo museum lottery (yay!) and were able to purchase the tickets. We also booked tickets for the Gion Corner theater in Kyoto. On 4/28, tickets for Universal Studios became available for the dates we wanted to go, June 22-23. I was able to get Express passes for 6/22, but they sold out very quickly, so stay on top of booking if that's something you're interested in. I secured our Pokemon Cafe reservations 1 month prior to when we wanted to go (search this sub for instructions on how to book - very useful information! It was a huge hassle). 6/10 we flew out from the US East Coast to Narita. \\~20 hours of travel time. We landed around 3pm Tokyo time on 6/11, and customs, etc. was not bad at all. We used Visit Japan Web to generate a QR code for each of us, saving us from filling out the paper customs form. We took the Narita Express into Shibuya, where we were staying in an Airbnb for this portion of the trip. It was in a nice neighborhood, about a 5 minute walk from the train station, and a 10-15 minute walk to Shibuya Scramble, shopping, etc. This was a great location to be based out of for us! 6/12 everyone woke up at 3:30am, so we walked to FamilyMart to pick up some breakfast. We left around 9:30 and headed to the Sunshine City mall in Ikebukuru, to check out the Pokemon center and the giant gachapon store (side note: budget for gachapon! They were EVERYWHERE, and so cool! All 4 of us came home with a ton). We also went to the flagship Animate store, then ate at Kura Sushi for lunch. We went over to Harajuku next and did a brief walk down Takeshita Street, where we got the giant cotton candy from Totti Candy Factory. We went back to the Airbnb for some rest after all that, then walked to Zauo, which is the fish for your own meal restaurant. It was fun, but very touristy. The kids had a good time, but it wasn't really worth the price in my opinion. We had way better meals on the trip, although the fish did taste very fresh. 6/13 we did a day trip to Kamakura and Enoshima. This day was probably one of my favorites of the entire trip, I highly recommend visiting if you can spare the day. We took the train from Tokyo to Kamakura and started by walking to the Sasuke Inari shrine (fox shrine). The kids loved this one, there are little fox statues everywhere, and a beautiful walkway with the red torii gates. We walked to Kotoku-in next to see the giant Buddha, then took the Enoshima Electric Railway to Enoshima. We ate a quick lunch at Lawson, then walked up what felt like 5,000 steps to Enoshima Shrine. We were heading to Iwaya Caves, but happened to be there during low tide, so we spent some time exploring the tide pools. The caves were very cool, I definitely recommend reading up on the lore before you go. It's very dark in some parts, so they give you a little candle and holder, which the kids loved. We headed back to Shibuya after hiking back down, and ate at a ramen restaurant near our Airbnb (Oreryo Shio - it was excellent). 6/14 headed to Nihonbashi to get to that Pokemon center as soon as it opened and browsed until it was time for our Pokemon Cafe reservation. If you or your kids (so all 4 of us, in our case) are into Pokemon, this was so worth it. The presentation of the food is incredible, and the taste was very good for a themed cafe. The kids absolutely loved the Pikachu show. We went back to Shibuya after and did some shopping. 6/15 went to Senso-ji to start the morning. We were there early and had a lovely time walking around the grounds and getting our fortunes. We went to the Pokemon center in Shibuya after, intending to do the t-shirt design lab they have at that location. In retrospect, I would recommend getting there as soon as the store opens to secure your spot. We got there maybe an hour after it opened and it took over 3 hours for our turn. We ate lunch and did some more shopping while we waited. After the kids designed their shirts, it was another 90 minutes until we could pick them up. We hadn't planned to do anything TeamLab, but we were able to get last-minute tickets for the evening for TeamLab Planets. I'm so glad we ended up going, it was so incredibly cool! 6/16 checked out of the Airbnb and headed for Tokyo Station, which is where we were catching the bullet train that afternoon. We left our luggage in a locker, and walked around near the Imperial Palace, then had lunch at Nemuro Hanamaru, a sushi train restaurant that was definitely worth the wait. Side note here. The stations in Tokyo are huge. Overwhelmingly huge. We left our luggage in a little locker alcove near the Shinkansen ticketing area. We got about 50 feet away when I thought maybe I should drop a pin, but figured nah, we'll be fine. Huge mistake. It was an absolute nightmare trying to navigate the station to find that little locker alcove again. It took over 2 hours, rebooking the Shinkansen tickets for a later time, and some very kind ladies working at the tourist information center to help us find that locker. We finally made it to the train for Kyoto, and checked into the Airbnb that evening. 6/17 was mostly a rest day, with a few short walks around the neighborhood. We ate at the Coco Ichibanya nearby, which my son was obsessed with. Our Airbnb had 2 outdoor soaking tubs, so we spend a lot of time in those just recovering from the trip so far. 6/18 we did a day trip to Minoo Park. It's \\~3km hike on a paved trail to the waterfall. Beautiful hike with some cool little shrines along the way. The waterfall was beautiful, and there are a few food stalls right next to it for a quick bite. There's also some restaurants along the trail. If you have an insect lover in your group, the Insectarium at the park was so cool. We had the place to ourselves, and the butterfly garden was beautiful. We headed back to Kyoto after that and had ramen for dinner in the station (Ippudo). 6/19 we did Arashiyama in the morning, and walked around the garden at Tenryu-Ji. Then we hiked to the monkey park, which the kids loved. For me, the view of Kyoto from the top made the climb to the monkey park worth it. We happened upon the kimono forest on the way back to the station, which was a neat little area. That evening, we went to the Gion Corner theater for a performance. I see some people complain that it's touristy, but for me, it was exactly what I wanted it to be - a short introduction to several different traditional art forms. There was flower arranging, Noh theater, tea ceremony, geiko/maiko dance, etc. The whole performance lasted \\~1 hr, and they provide a translator with information about each act. After the performance, we walked around Gion at dusk, which was beautiful. 6/20 started the day at Fushimi Inari and ended up going all the way to the top (side note: before we started up, we found a tanuki statue at a shop, which is the one souvenir our son was desperate to get. We hadn't really seen any before this, so I'm glad we found one here). We ended up coming down a back way and wound up in a residential neighborhood that led us to Tofuki-ji temple and the Tsutenkyo bridge. That afternoon was our reservation at the Nintendo museum. I loved it, the exhibits on the upper floor were very well done, and we had a great time playing on the giant controllers. 6/21 we left the Airbnb in Kyoto and headed to Nara. We dropped our bags at the hotel (Hotel Tenpyo Naramachi - I highly recommend this place, it was fantastic. Great location, great room, great service). We walked through the park to see the deer. They're very sweet and friendly. However, after watching other people buy the biscuits and attempt to feed them, we opted not to feed them ourselves. Next we went over to Todai-ji Daibutsuden and saw the giant Buddha, and ate lunch at another sushi train restaurant on the shopping street (Kaiten Sushi Totogin). 6/22 they brought a traditional breakfast to the room for us, which was delicious. We checked out of the hotel and headed to Universal Studios. This was our Express pass day. We dropped our bags at the hotel (Hotel Universal Port), and headed to the park. Koopa's Challenge was definitely the number one ride I would recommend the Express pass for. I think the line was estimated at 130 minutes, and we waited maybe 20 with the Express pass. Minion Mayhem was fun, and Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey was really cool. 6/23 it started pouring as soon as we got through security. They suspended service on some of the rides at the beginning of the day, but everything ended up opening back up after the storms passed. We were able to get a timed entry into Super Nintendo World again. We did the Yoshi's Adventure ride, which was cute and gives you a great view of the entire area. We also did the Jurassic Park ride, which was super fun. We took the Shinkansen back to Tokyo that evening for our final night in Japan. 6/24 our flight wasn't until 5, so we walked around Ueno Park and the surrounding area. We got to Narita plenty early, and walked around the shopping area there. We ate ramen one last time, then headed home. And that was it! It was an incredible trip, I hope this helps someone! There's so much we wanted to do that we didn't get around to, I'm looking forward to going back again! Some other random things to note - we all took an Eki stamp book, but never saw a single place to stamp. Getting through stations was such an ordeal, finding a stamp was the last thing that was on my mind. We also didn't find any of the Pokemon manhole covers. Same kind of thing, I guess we could have looked up their exact location on a map, but I wasn't about to drag everyone out of the way for something so small when we were already walking 20k+ steps every day. Through reading on Reddit and through my own experience, I learned that everything you have planned takes waaaay longer to experience and navigate to than you're anticipating, so my little side quests fell to the wayside. Anyway, hope this helps, happy to answer any questions!"}

This was a food-first, fall-season trip covering **Tokyo ‚Üí Fuji ‚Üí Kyoto ‚Üí Nara ‚Üí back to Tokyo**. **Travel Dates:** November 19 ‚Äì December 4 We booked **ANA economy round-trip with points** for both of us. Carried 2 checked bags + 1 carry-on each (in hindsight, way too much). Pre-reserved everything possible ‚Äî restaurant bookings, train tickets, even luggage forwarding ‚Äî and it made the trip smoother. Japan e-visa was straightforward, but I recommend applying early just in case. **Day 1 ‚Äì Arrival, Sensoji, Ginza, Shopping and Fine Dining** Landed 5AM at Haneda, took a direct train to Ginza (great with bags). Hotel was 3 min from station. Picked up 72/48hr subway passes and used Suica via Apple Wallet (highly recommend). Quick breakfast from FamilyMart and Lawson ‚Äî egg sando, Famichiki, coffee (buy cup ‚Üí use machine). Stocked up on Fibe Mini + veggie juice ‚Äî helpful for digestion during travel. Visited Sensoji early in light rain ‚Äî peaceful, no crowds. Tourist center has a great photo spot. Nakamise shops were shut that early. Lunch: Ramen Hayashida ‚Äî clean chicken shoyu broth, they use duck to add a gamey richness to the flavor. Back to Ginza: shopping at Mitsukoshi (free membership = 5% off), Ginza 6, TSUTAYA and Loft. Jet lag hit by afternoon. Dinner at Tempura Kondo ‚Äî precise, delicate tempura, seasonal ingredients. Formal vibe but excellent quality (they even change the oil mid-way). Sweet potato &amp; Asparagus tempura was a standout. **Day 2 ‚Äì Toyosu Auction, TeamLab Planets, First Omakase, Shinjuku + Omotesando, Yakitori** Started early with a 5AM taxi to Toyosu Market (plenty available outside hotels). We'd won the auction lottery and had a 5:30AM guided tour ‚Äî highly recommend if you‚Äôre curious about the bluefin tuna auction. You‚Äôre taken right up to the action on a raised platform, and it‚Äôs fascinating to watch how fast and precise it all is. Post-auction, wandered around the vegetable and seafood sections ‚Äî lots to see beyond the restaurants. Breakfast queues were huge, so we grabbed snacks and coffee instead. With time to kill before our 9AM Teamlab Planets slot, we visited Toyosu Manyo Club (great early-bird rate). The rooftop footbath with skyline views and natural spring onsen were perfect to unwind after the early start. Teamlab Planets at 9AM was a great call ‚Äî fewer crowds. Spent \\~90 minutes exploring. Took the bus back to Ginza. Lunch at Sushi Suzuki was the best nigiri of the trip ‚Äî incredibly refined, and the progression was beautifully paced. Very little English is spoken, but fellow diners (local, bilingual) helped bridge gaps. Warm, friendly experience despite the upscale setting. Afternoon in Shinjuku ‚Äî checked out the observation deck at Tokyo Metropolitan Govt. Building, explored Omoide Yokocho, and did classic Don Quijote shopping. Then walked through Omotesando and browsed some flagship stores and boutiques ‚Äî architecture alone is worth the visit. Dinner at Yakitori Hirano in Ginza ‚Äî casual but elevated, with a sake pairing that really worked. They use the Binchotan coal that burns with minimal smoke and odor, preventing flavor contamination of food. The Grilled skewers were perfectly timed and seasoned; fun counter seating and a chill end to a long day. **Day 3 ‚Äì Coffee, Standing Sushi, Streetwear, Transfer to Kawaguchiko** Had a relaxed morning ‚Äî dropped bags with the hotel for forwarding (super smooth, concierge handled everything). Started the day with lattes at Roar Coffee ‚Äî great roast variety and you can choose your beans. Late breakfast at Tachiguizushi Akira (standing sushi). High quality, fast-paced, and flexible ‚Äî you can pre-select your favorites and can repeat pieces. We went heavy on uni and chutoro ‚Äî no regrets. Spent the afternoon in Shibuya and Harajuku ‚Äî picked up running bibs for the Mt. Fuji marathon and did some streetwear shopping (Onitsuka Tiger, etc.). Fall colors were starting to pop ‚Äî lots of bright yellows across the parks and streets. Now for the tricky part: bus transfer to Kawaguchiko. From Ginza, we took the train to Shinjuku Station, then had to find the bus terminal ‚Äî it‚Äôs in another building, a fair walk away, and located on an upper floor. Shinjuku is massive and confusing, and we weren‚Äôt expecting such a sprint before a race ‚Äî plan extra time here. Bus to Kawaguchiko got us in around 7:30PM. Most restaurants were closed, so we had stocked up on konbini snacks and bentos earlier. Ate in and slept early. **Day 4 ‚Äì Mt. Fuji Marathon Fun Run &amp; Ryokan** Checked out of our hotel in the morning ‚Äî great balcony views of Mt. Fuji, with red and gold fall foliage all around. Ran the Mt. Fuji charity fun run (13.5km) ‚Äî stunning experience. Crisp weather (5‚Äì10¬∞C, sunny), and by 10AM Fuji was completely visible, towering right ahead on the course. The race was well-organized with food/snacks post-run, and the medal + Mt. Fuji-themed swag (towel, tee, etc.) were top-notch. After cheering on the full marathon runners, we checked out and headed to Ubuya Ryokan for a 3PM check-in. Got a room with a private onsen on the balcony ‚Äî worth the splurge. Ended the day with a cozy shabu-shabu dinner and a long soak. **Day 5 ‚Äì Fuji Sightseeing** Started with a traditional Japanese breakfast at Ubuya ‚Äî grilled fish, miso soup, pickled vegetables, egg, and tea. Checked out and spent the day exploring the area. Walked to Oishi Park for postcard views of Mt. Fuji over Lake Kawaguchiko ‚Äî peak fall colors made it extra scenic. Had pastries at amazing Patisserie Esperance and tried Cremia ice cream. Then hopped on the Fuji sightseeing bus, which loops around key spots like Maple Corridor, Kawaguchiko Music Forest, and Chureito Pagoda (you won‚Äôt hit everything in a day, but it‚Äôs a relaxed way to get around). Dinner at Hotel - Ishiyaki Style ‚Äî hot stone‚Äìgrilled wagyu beef, rich and tender with seasonal side dishes. Simple, satisfying end to the day before turning in. **Day 6 ‚Äì Mishima Shinkansen Saga, Arrival in Kyoto, Rainy Evening** Slow morning ‚Äî soaked in the last views of Mt. Fuji before checking out. Had an early lunch at Chante le Vent in Kawaguchiko ‚Äî cozy floral caf√© with excellent Japanese-style curry and brewed coffee. Also started binging on local fruits, especially strawberries ‚Äî so sweet and fresh everywhere from here on. Took the bus to Mishima Station for the Shinkansen to Kyoto‚Ä¶ and then came the chaos: we rushed onto the train and I accidentally left my backpack on a station bench. Panicked, but the train staff were incredible ‚Äî they called Mishima Station, confirmed the bag was there, and we got off at the next stop to turn back. Sure enough, the bag was still untouched ‚Äî the staff just smiled and said, \"No one touches personal belongings here\" Seriously impressive. We lost about an hour but hopped on the next train using our same ticket (in unreserved seats) ‚Äî smooth process. Arrived in Kyoto, grabbed a quick McDonald's snack (shrimp burger + shaka shaka chicken ‚Äî both worth trying), then checked into our hotel near Marutamachi Dori &amp; Gyoen Garden. Evening walk in the rain through Nishiki Market and Gion ‚Äî the warm lights and reflections made it feel magical. Ended the night with a teppanyaki dinner at Steak Mouriya ‚Äî Kobe beef cooked in front of you, perfectly tender, rich, and balanced. Took the bus everywhere in Kyoto ‚Äî super efficient and easy to navigate. **Day 7 ‚Äì Arashiyama, Temples, Fall Foliage, Kiyomizudera Illumination** Started early in Arashiyama ‚Äî even at sunrise, crowds build fast in Kyoto‚Äôs major spots. Went first to Gi≈çji Temple for a calm walk around its moss gardens. Then walked through Tenryuji Temple and its garden paths, surrounded by peak fall foliage ‚Äî reds, yellows, and oranges everywhere. Lunch at Shigetsu, inside Tenryuji ‚Äî a serene Buddhist vegetarian meal served on floor mats, beautifully presented and deeply flavorful. Then wandered the main street for snacks and souvenirs (lots of sampling!). Had nice Taiyaki at Mamemono to Taiyaki. Next: Ryoanji Temple ‚Äî peaceful and uncrowded, with wide walking paths and a quieter vibe. Then to Kinkakuji (Golden Pavilion) ‚Äî striking reflection on the pond, gleaming against the fall trees. Crowded but worth it. Late afternoon in Higashiyama, visiting Yasaka Pagoda (H≈çkan-ji) and sipping incredible matcha at Gokago ‚Äî best we had all trip, ended up buying a lot (should‚Äôve bought double). The narrow sloping lanes were buzzing with energy. Walked up to Kiyomizudera for the night illumination ‚Äî visually stunning with light filtering through the autumn leaves, but absolutely packed. Could barely move hands while walking, so we left sooner than planned. Took a taxi (traffic was heavy) to Tempura Kawatatsu for dinner ‚Äî cozy, 8-seat traditional spot. Tempura set meals with sake pairing, low tables, and a chill crowd. Lovely 2-hour dinner, with fun conversation from the locals. **Day 8 ‚Äì Fushimi Inari, Philosopher‚Äôs Path, Soba &amp; Kaiseki** Early start at Fushimi Inari ‚Äî hiked halfway up under a clear blue sky. Peaceful and energizing. From there, we went north toward Yasaka Pagoda and Yasaka Shrine ‚Äî fewer crowds than usual since many shops were still closed in the morning. Stopped at Ippodo Tea Store for some excellent matcha and gifts, then kept walking north to the Philosopher‚Äôs Path. Calm, quiet stream-side trail lined with trees in peak foliage ‚Äî a perfect contrast to Kyoto‚Äôs busier areas. Lunch at Juugo ‚Äî a tiny soba spot run by a solo chef. You sit at the counter, and watch him hand-cut and serve one perfect dish: cold soba with dipping sauce. Easily the best soba I‚Äôve had ‚Äî clean, firm, deeply flavorful. Visited Ginkaku-ji after ‚Äî was our favorite temple garden in Kyoto. Subtle, natural, and atmospheric, especially with the fall colors in full swing. Did some final souvenir shopping nearby before heading back to the hotel. Dinner at Muromachi Wakuden ‚Äî an unforgettable kaiseki experience. Around 15‚Äì16 courses over 2.5 hours, with an emphasis on pure, seasonal flavors. Dishes were elegant and restrained, letting the ingredients speak for themselves ‚Äî no unnecessary embellishments. Service was impeccable, and the space serene. Popular with locals, and rightfully so. A quiet, refined end to our Kyoto stay. **Day 9 ‚Äì Nara Day Trip &amp; Back to Tokyo** We‚Äôd done luggage forwarding the night before (a lifesaver again). Honestly wish we had one more day in Kyoto, but it was time to move on. Took the train to Nara, started with coffee at Rokumei Coffee ‚Äî smooth brews, minimal interiors, great start. Then wandered Nara Park, where the famously polite bowing deer gently nudge you for treats. Fun, slightly chaotic, but charming once you get the hang of it. Visited T≈çdaiji Temple ‚Äî hands down my favorite temple structure of the trip. The scale is stunning ‚Äî this massive wooden building houses a towering Buddha statue, and the architectural detail is breathtaking. The surrounding gardens were glowing in fall colors. Lunch at Wakakusa Curry ‚Äî got the 4-curry combo to try a bit of everything. Flavorful, comforting, and totally different from Japanese curry chains. Topped it off with some fresh hand-pounded mochi nearby ‚Äî soft, warm, and deeply satisfying. Took the sightseeing limited express back to Kyoto, then caught the Shinkansen to Tokyo. Caught one last glimpse of Fuji from the train window, framed in golden light ‚Äî felt like a perfect sendoff from the Kansai region. Back in Tokyo that evening, we visited Rikugien Gardens for the autumn night illumination ‚Äî a quiet, romantic spot with softly lit trees and reflecting ponds which gave it a peaceful, intimate vibe. Lots of locals, especially couples on dates. A lovely way to re-enter the city. Wrapped up the night with dinner at Ramen Nishino ‚Äî a delicate, fish-based broth where the bonito hits first, followed by a light shoyu finish. The soup is airy, clean, and deeply comforting. Topped with silky shrimp wontons, it was the kind of bowl that warms you without overwhelming. **Day 10 ‚Äì TeamLab Borderless, Azabudai Hills, Omakase, Mega Illumination, Neapolitan Pizza** Started early from our hotel right next to Akasaka Station ‚Äî super convenient for getting around. Had nice coffee at % Arabica and then headed to Teamlab Borderless. We had the first time slot ‚Äî highly recommend it for fewer crowds. Take your time exploring; some rooms reveal themselves only if you linger. Stopped for a drink in the Tea Room, which added a nice pause. Spent about 2 hours inside. Next, wandered through the newly opened Azabudai Hills Mall ‚Äî sleek, upscale, and easily my favorite mall in Tokyo. Also checked out the Azabudai Christmas Market, which was small but charming and festive. Lunch was a major highlight: a 33-course omakase at Nishiazabu Taku, with wine pairing. Easily one of the best omakase experiences we had on the trip ‚Äî full write-up here. The meal lasted about 2.5 hours and felt refined yet relaxed. Post-lunch stroll to the Nezu Museum, with its serene garden paths and traditional architecture ‚Äî a great reset after a big meal. Evening at Tokyo Mega Illumination (Tokyo City Keiba racetrack) ‚Äî lesser known but well-executed, with glowing light tunnels, animated exhibits, and plenty of space to walk around. Dinner at La Tripletta, a bit further south but totally worth it. Classic Neapolitan pizza ‚Äî chewy, blistered crusts from the wood-fired oven. We tried the mushroom veggie and salami pizzas ‚Äî both cooked to perfection. Casual but satisfying end to a long day. **Day 11 ‚Äì Azabudai, Akihabara, Omakase-Kaiseki Meal** Started the morning near Azabudai Hills at **Maison Landemaine** ‚Äî a classic Parisian-style bakery with incredibly flaky pastries and great coffee. Also grabbed cookies from **√âchir√©**, known for their famous butter ‚Äî a nice edible souvenir. Then spent the afternoon in **Akihabara**, Tokyo‚Äôs mecca for anime, games, and electronics. We were on a mission to find a **Cardcaptor Sakura wand**, which we did! Also browsed **Gachapon Hall**, retro game stores, and the multi-floor **Yodobashi Camera**, which is an experience even if you‚Äôre not buying tech. Dinner at **Ichi-u**, a refined restaurant offering a mix of **kaiseki and sushi omakase**. The evening begins with a cup of sake; soup and steamed dishes are then served. After the sushi, **takikomi gohan** ‚Äî rice with a variety of ingredients ‚Äî concludes the meal, showcasing a broad range of technique. Presentation is thoughtful, and they have a strong wine list, which paired surprisingly well throughout the meal. The space is intimate, and the service was warm without being formal. The area around **Shirokane-Takanawa** (where the restaurant is located) felt quiet and upscale ‚Äî a nice contrast to Akihabara earlier in the day. **Day 12 ‚Äì Yokohama Day Trip, Christmas Illuminations, Comfort Food** Took an early train to **Yokohama**. Breakfast at **Bills Yokohama** by the waterfront ‚Äî fluffy **ricotta pancakes** with a breezy ocean view. Relaxed and scenic start. Next stop: the **Cup Noodles Museum** ‚Äî genuinely fun and creative. You design your own cup, pick custom flavors and toppings, and even watch the sealing process. Sampled different noodle styles at the **Noodles Bazaar**, styled like an international food court ‚Äî quirky and worth it. Then strolled around **Yamashita Park**, the **Red Brick Warehouse**, and **Osanbashi Pier** ‚Äî wide open harbor views and modern design make it a great walking area. Headed back to **Ginza** and joined the famous **Ginza Kagari** queue ‚Äî waited about 1.5 hours, but absolutely worth it. Their signature **creamy chicken paitan ramen** is rich yet refined ‚Äî a silky, almost broth-like potage with tender chicken, seasonal vegetables, and a drizzle of truffle oil. Clean, warming, and deeply satisfying. In the afternoon, walked through the **golden ginkgo trees of Jingu Gaien** ‚Äî peak color, glowing yellow everywhere. Stayed on for the **evening illumination**, then wandered through **Omotesando**, **Minami Aoyama**, and **Roppongi Hills** to take in the Christmas markets, lights and street displays ‚Äî Tokyo does winter lights incredibly well. Wrapped the night with the chaos of **Shibuya Scramble**, then dinner at **Hikiniku to Come** ‚Äî a hidden gem for **charcoal-grilled hamburger steak**. You grill each patty yourself at the counter; the texture and smokiness are incredible. Ended the night with a classic **FamilyMart souffl√© pudding** (honestly had one daily by this point), and a few drinks at a nearby **izakaya**. **Day 13 ‚Äì Kitchenware Haul, Good Food and Tokyo Tower Views** Started the morning at **Menya Itto** ‚Äî famous for their **tsukemen (dipping ramen)**. The noodles were thick, springy, and served cold alongside a deep, umami-rich chicken and seafood broth. Rich without being heavy ‚Äî easily one of my favorite bowls of the trip. Then headed to **Nakamise Dori** for a bit of street food and people-watching. Tried a few snacks and made our way to **Fuglen Caf√©** ‚Äî great spot for a pour-over. Also shopped for some more souvenirs. Next up: **Kappabashi Street**, aka kitchenware heaven. We went in for a look and came out with **sake sets, ramen bowls, handmade glasses**, and even a **custom knife**. Some shops cater to restaurants, and a chef we‚Äôd met earlier actually pointed us to specific stores for good quality goods. Highly recommend if you love to cook! Dinner at **Hatano Yoshiki** was another highlight ‚Äî a very well balanced omakase. What really stood out was the chef himself ‚Äî speaks great English, super friendly, and happy to explain each dish in detail. The vibe is lively and warm, and even though we were the only non-Japanese guests that night, it felt incredibly welcoming. Some of the plating and ingredients were also totally unique ‚Äî not your typical sushi omakase. Ended the evening at the **Tokyo Tower top deck**, then circled back to the **Azabudai Hills Christmas Market** for one last round of lights. The lighting here was the best we saw in Tokyo, and the **hot chocolate** from one of the stalls was surprisingly great ‚Äî rich, not too sweet, and perfect for the walk. **Day 14 ‚Äì Final Bites, City Strolls, and a Tokyo Sendoff** Started the day walking through the **Harry Potter‚Äìthemed entrance of Akasaka Station** ‚Äî a small but magical touch on our way out. Checked out, finished final packing, and went for one last **omakase at Sushi Satake**. The chef‚Äôs style stands out with slightly warmer sushi rice, larger cuts, and especially high-quality tuna. A bold, satisfying end to our sushi streak. Spent the afternoon wandering **Meiji Jingu** and **Yoyogi Park**, soaking in the calm before heading to **Roppongi Hills** and **Shiba Park** to get a final photo of **Tokyo Tower** lit up against the evening sky. Our final meal was at **PST Pizza** ‚Äî Tokyo‚Äôs take on **Neapolitan pizza**.

None of my trip report contains anything different than most people, except I chose to stay at a different hotel in a different neighborhood each night. How I planned my trip, what I did, what I packed, and my expenses are all listed out below in various levels of detail. If you like detail, keep reading. If not, this probably isn‚Äôt the post for you. I‚Äôm hoping that putting these keywords in will help somebody searching for specific info. A few photos are here: https://imgur.com/a/s3cnAFF (I think, first time on Imgur) **Background-** 43F solo traveler on a budget using mostly points/miles, likes cities and is confident navigating them, loves hotels and wants to stay in every single one, coldest person alive and happy one-bagger (with lots of other bags ready for different scenarios because of being the coldest person alive), not a foodie, technically visited Japan previously but was 7. I‚Äôve always enjoyed walking and seek that out, but in my daily life I am as equally likely to walk 500 steps a day (WFH in the winter) as 50,000 (a running day when I‚Äôm dogsitting). I run 15-20 miles a week and have every foot, knee, and hip issue from that, but for whatever reason my body really likes to walk. I record all my walks on my Garmin watch/Strava because I like to see where I went. Hyatt Explorist, Hilton and Marriott Gold. Can sleep anywhere, jetlag not an issue. Before arriving in Japan I spent 5 days in Doha and 3 days in Bangkok (I flew around the world on this trip!). **Long term planning-** google/IG/blog/reddit/word of mouth searched and pinned to google maps everything I could possibly be interested in, including recommended running routes and baseball games. Pinned the Hyatt hotels where I could get free nights. Built an itinerary that had me moving every night, but in a way that was naturally moving from one neighborhood/hotel and group of sites/attractions to the next. Picked end of May due to the US Memorial Day holiday allowing me an extra day off work, and was hoping for warm weather/missing the highest costs of the earlier spring. Opened credit cards that got me the flights I wanted. Made a spreadsheet to start narrowing everything down. **Medium term planning-** made reservations/got tickets for the very limited time-based plans that I made- two baseball games, one lunch, and one ‚Äúrace.‚Äù I made Disney plans for specific days because I got a vacation package, but I kind of count that separately since it‚Äôs not a common thing to do and I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily recommend it. The regular evening Disney ticket I bought was purchased the night before. Everything else was on the fly/didn‚Äôt need specific timing. Went clothes shopping because all I wear are bright leggings and graphic tees. I found the perfect clothing (for me) that was comfortable, practical, and fit in better with what other people around me were wearing. Opened a free Charles Schwab debit account to receive an ATM card that would reimburse foreign ATM fees (there is probably a better way to word this, but if you search there‚Äôs tons of info). **Short term planning-** Got a data only Airolo eSIM for one phone (no issues with service), got a Minternational Text/Call only package for my second phone (no issues). Downloaded offline maps. Dowloaded google translate (and a bunch of other apps that I never used). Got my immigration QR code. Added the Suica transit card to my Apple wallet the night before and easily added funds from my stored credit cards (this is how my city‚Äôs transit system works so it was the obvious option for me). Got an unreserved Shinkansen ticket at the station just before boarding. Reviewed and revised my spreadsheet before the start of each day based on what I had seen/wanted to see. I ended up keeping the framework and only shifting a few things around. *Things I was not interested in:* anime, manga, Nintendo, Universal, teamLab, paying for views, shopping, nightlife/drinking, eating anything but snacks and fast casual **TLDR:** 11 days/10 nights, 10 hotels in Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ginza, Maihama, DisneySea, Akihabara, Odaiba, Yokohama, Kyoto, KIX airport. Weather low 50s-mid 70s Farenheit, with 3.5 solidly rainy days, 3.5 solidly sunny days, and the rest overcast (it rained at some point on 7 different days). I walked a lot, but because I wanted to rarely because I needed to. **Sites/Activities (and the neighborhoods around them):** Tokyo Tower Climb, Olympic Museum, Caf√© Reissue for dog latte art, Little Mermaid lunch at Oh My Caf√©, Yoyogi Park, Meguro River run, Hachiko statue, Meiji-jingu, Takeshita Street, Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, Tokyo Dome, Godzilla lights, Senso-ji, Nakamise Street, Don Quixote, Sumida River Walk, Ueno shopping streets, Tokyo Station, Ginza Itoya, Kura Sushi, Imperial Palace run, Tsukiji Outer Market, Ikspiari, Tokyo Disneyland, Tokyo DisneySea, Origami Museum, Hie shrine, Statue of Liberty, Unicorn Gundam show, Rainbow Bridge run, Yokohama Stadium, Yamashita Park/rose garden, Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse, Nippon Maru, Yokohama Port Museum, Yokohama Port Festival, Sannenzaka, Ninenzaka, Yasaka, Shirakawa Canal, Kamo River, Fushimi Inari, Nishiki Market, Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kinkaju-ji, Higashiyama-ji, Philosopher‚Äôs Path, Dotonburi, Nakau, United Cinemas Odaiba **Miles recorded on Strava:** 114.65 walking and 12.5 running **Highest step day:** 62,040 (Kyoto and Osaka) **Lowest step day:** 21,674 (departure day) **Non-award travel expenses** (all on CC-Chase or Amex-unless cash as noted) - *ESims:* 17USD Airolo + 5USD Mint (used 4.5 of my Airolo 6GB, but also kept my phone on airplane mode when I wasn‚Äôt actively navigating because the first couple days drained it excessively) - *Airfare:* miles + 74USD taxes - *Hotels:* points + 143USD for the 9 non-Disney package nights plus 100USD in pool visits/an upgrade - *Transportation:* 7,882JPY from Suica on trains and lockers - *Food:* included in cash plus about 22,000JPY from CC - *Activities:* included in cash plus about 125USD - *Souvenirs:* included in cash plus about 22,500JPY from CC - *Cash from ATM:* 30,000JPY (12,650JPY to Shinkansen ticket, the rest to food, activities, and souvenirs) *A note on cash vs. CC-* I wanted and needed cash for the street food and some site fees. I took out 10,000JPY at the airport because it was the lowest amount, and I didn‚Äôt pay attention to how I spent it. As in, I used cash in some places where I could have used a card. With a few days left in the trip I realized I would need more cash, but the lowest amount the ATM would give me was also 10,000JPY, which was way too much for a few more snacks and entrance fees. *I did not go seeking other ATMs, and I did not ask anyone or google whether it was possible to find an ATM with a lower minimum* Instead I took out 20,000JPY and used cash for the Shinkansen ticket (not all ticket machines take cash but I found one that did). That left me with more cash than I had originally wanted, but at least less than 10,000JPY to spend in a few days. I definitely had extra that I spent down at the airport, but I don‚Äôt regret those purchases and it all worked out. Just a note for your planning in case you run into this also. **MVPs of my trip:** - my sandals that I did all my walking in (brought running shoes that I only wore for the runs). I‚Äôve worn other pairs of these for at least a hundred miles at home, so I knew that they would be my main source of footware and I never had any issues. I brought socks in a Ziploc in case I needed to take them off, but anywhere I needed to do that provided slippers. - an inflatable seat cushion that I brought for the plane ride there and was ready to ditch if it was too much to carry. I‚Äôm so glad I held onto it- I spent hours sitting at Disney waiting (by choice) very comfortably. Other than that I don‚Äôt have any tips that haven‚Äôt already been said. Sometimes I found trash cans when I wanted, sometimes I didn‚Äôt- mostly I just stuffed wrappers in my bag til later, but in one case there was messy food residue on the packaging so I used one of the dog poop bags I had brought for this purpose. If you didn‚Äôt bring anything no worries, your hotel probably has a small plastic bag labeled ‚Äúsanitary bag‚Äù that you could use for this purpose. I didn‚Äôt find my hotel beds too firm at all, would never have noticed had I not read about it here beforehand. I was tickled by the idea of being given pajamas to sleep in at every hotel, and utilized each set, though they are definitely not sized for all bodies (only one hotel, the Akihabara Bay capsule hotel, noted that you could request larger sizes). I enjoyed Tokyo as a clean, safe, and pedestrian-friendly city with reliable public transportation. I will miss the lockers, quiet transportation rides with low wait times, snacks, and nice people. I am happy to have more color, light switches that I know where to find, and jaywalking back in my life (and see more dogs every day). **What I would do differently planning this exact trip-** go when it is warmer, get baseball seats in the cheering sections, bring a few sheets of paper soap or put some in a mini container (the lack of hand towels didn‚Äôt bother me), go to the Haneda JAL airport museum- I only found out about this the day before my layover, have no idea how it never came up in my million google searches. This is something I would have *loved* but needs reservations and they fill up much farther in advance **What I skipped from my original plan:** *Free government building viewpoint-* it was cloudy that day and I realized the view from Tokyo Tower climb was good enoughfor the trip *Sunset kayak around Tokyo Skytreee area-* I didn‚Äôt sign up for this, but considered it on my Ginza evening. Ultimately I decided I would be too cold to enjoy it, and I was right. If I were back in warmer weather I would definitely do this **Souvenirs I got** (paid, the photo shows everything I took home that was ‚Äúfree‚Äù): Disney: backpack, hat, monorail toy, small plush, towel x4, tote bag x2 (and a glass that broke in my bag the day after I got it). Non-Disney: postcards, magnet, pin to make into a magnet, dish towels x2. For friends/family (not pictured): socks, a tote bag, matcha kitkats, 7-11 snacks. # Ok here‚Äôs the detailed day-by-day itinerary: **Saturday** - land Haneda- stepped off plane 05:56, through immigration 06:04 (combination of off-peak time, being in the first group off the plane, and being a fast walker down the airport halls) - Keikyu line to Daimon Station (leave bag in a locker) for the Tell Tokyo Tower Climb. I always search for local races when I travel and this was the closest I could find. It seemed like mostly expats and was a great intro to the city- I wasn‚Äôt going to go to the tower or pay for any views so I got to do both those in one go to benefit a charity. I was nervous about making it there in time straight from the airport but the timing worked out great. It sells out so plan ahead if you are interested. - subway to Shibuya to drop bag at hotel - walking: get on waiting list at Reissue Cafe, Olympic Museumwhile waiting, return to Caf√© Reissue for 3D latte art of my soul dog, Little Mermaid lunch at Oh My Caf√©, Yoyogi Park - laundry, quick nap, walk around in evening exploring/looking for dinner - Night: Hyatt House Shibuya. The location is super convenient to the station, but less so the neighborhood on the other side- my google maps (and brain) struggled to navigate the construction areas. By the third time leaving and returning I had figured it out better, so if you are there a week it will be no big deal, but I definitely spent some extra time wandering looking for the right entrance(s). In-room laundry more than made up for that inconvenience though- it was pretty life changing to have clean clothes after a week and to have it right there while I was doing other things - **Observations:** Reissue and Oh My Cafes were my two gimmicky meals, and I‚Äôm glad I did them for the novelty but someone else could certainly skip them. I loved the Olympic Museum though and would recommend to anyone- it‚Äôs small but very interactive in ways I haven‚Äôt seen before. Overall the weather was pretty gloomy- overcast and at times raining- which was very noticeable after coming from the sun and warmth of Doha and BKK and probably gave Tokyo an unfair disadvantage in the immediate comparisons I made. *Steps:* 37,646 **Sunday** - 3 mile rainy run to Meguro river (I can see how it would be pretty with the blossoms) and Hachi statue all to myself shower, dry my wet running clothes, check out, metro to Yoyogi, leave bags in locker - walking: Meiji Jingu, street snacks on Takeshita Street, Shinjuku Gyoen gardens, Tokyo Dome for baseball game - Giants vs. Swallows- I got these tickets as a backup for the game I really wanted to go to later in the week in Yokohama (the NPB sub was very helpful in giving advice about the atmospheres of different stadiums and teams, but go to npbtickets for info on tickets), which I thought had a good chance of being rained out. The covered Tokyo Dome game meant I could guarantee seeing a game during my trip. I‚Äôm a very casual baseball fan and just went for the atmosphere, and I‚Äôm so glad that I planned on having lunch there because the themed and player-endorsed food options were really fun. - Subway back to Yoyogi to get bag - Walking: check in hotel, explore Shinjuku, see the Godzilla show, find dinner - Night: 7 Hours Women Shinjuku. I stayed in a capsule hotel as a kid and loved it and knew I wanted to go back, for fun and also #budget. I picked this one because the idea of the sleep test, however inaccurate it would turn out to be, sounded fun. Capsule hotels (and ones that monitor your sleep) are not for everyone! I loved it though and would definitely recommend. - **Observations:** still kind of gloomy, and kind of realizing that maybe the Shibuya/Shinjuku neighborhoods just aren‚Äôt for me (which is weird, because I like busy cities and even enjoy going to Times Square). I loved the gardens. Baseball was fun but the games can be quite long compared to MLB so budget the time or be prepared to leave early. *Steps:* 43,484 **Monday** - subway to hotel to leave bag, subway to Asakusa - walking: Senso-ji and Asakusa, Sumida River Walk, Ueno shopping street, scoped out the location of my upcoming Akihabara hotel, Tokyo Station, Ginza - quick nap at hotel, dinner at Kura Sushi, shopping at Itoya - Night: Hyatt Centric Ginza. I‚Äôve seen various arguments for and against this hotel, but it worked great for me. - **Observations:** the sun made an appearance! That made a huge difference in my mood. Get to Senso-ji the earlier the better but definitely before 9. Public bathrooms are amazing. I liked Ginza more than I expected and I think it‚Äôs because it has trees! *Steps:* 37,643 **Tuesday** - 5.5 mile run to/around Imperial Palace - Walking: Tsukiji fish market for breakfast, Tokyo station - Subway to Maihama, monorail to Bayside station - Walking: hotel to drop bag, Ikspiari to explore/shop, Lawson for supplies, pick up vacation package paperwork at MiraCosta - I got an evening ticket to Tokyo DisneySea (5pm entry) and will write about that in a separate trip report for that sub. - Night: Tokyo Maihama Bay First Hotel. Definitely the oldest/most worn place I stayed, but in no way was that a negative- it did exactly what I needed it to (cheap enough, safe, clean, convenient, and even quiet). - **Observations:** Disney is not for everyone and I would never try to force it, but if you are mildly interested and have time an evening DisneySea ticket is the perfect low commitment taste of an experience quite different than any of the other US parks. The konbinis are not the most conveniently located there, so if you are dead set an specific snacks (like I was) and don‚Äôt want to walk (I was fine with that part) go to one closer to where you were before you arrived to the Disney area. *Steps:* 44,271 **Wednesday** - Tokyo Disneyland ‚ÄúEnjoy Unlimited Rides on Eligible Attractions ‚Äì 2 Days‚Äù vacation package- separate trip report to come - Night: Tokyo DisneySea Hotel MiraCosta. I made a point to build in a (brief) swim time this day, but otherwise I was only in the hotel to sleep and eat breakfast. I‚Äôm glad I picked up my paperwork here the day before because I walked around it and took pictures then when I wasn‚Äôt feeling the pressure of the park schedule. - **Observations:** I saw the least amount of tourist-appearing people on this day of the whole trip. I found the US/Japan park differences mildly interesting, but the Disney culture differences fascinating. One thing I appreciated is the ability to walk everywhere- I‚Äôm the kind of person that looks forward to stretching my legs on the walk back to the hotel after a day in the parks. WDW take note!! *Steps:* 30,780 **Thursday** - Tokyo DisneySea ‚ÄúEnjoy Unlimited Rides on Eligible Attractions ‚Äì 2 Days‚Äù vacation package- separate trip report to come - Night: Akihabara Bay Hotel (capsule hotel 2/2). I loved this hotel and have a lot of notes comparing it to the other capsule I stayed in- both are good for different things. This mattress was less comfortable, but I was pooped and it didn‚Äôt matter- went to bed early and slept in a little. - **Observations:** over ate and under walked, but a fun day that was not lessened by leaving the park early- I did the evening show on Tuesday so I wouldn‚Äôt feel the pressure to stay the whole time and get to the next hotel late *Steps:* 26,826 **Friday** - Walking: origami museum (super cute and recommend if you are nearby, but not necessarily for a special trip), leave bags at Hibiya station, Hie shrine, Akasaka, Toranomon Hills, pick up bags, Shimbashi station - Subway to Odaiba, check in and drop bags - Walking: Odaiba, Statue of Liberty, unicorn gundam light show - Night: Hilton Odaiba. The view of the bridge was stunning, even in crummy weather. I splurged on a pool/spa pass and spent the evening in the outdoor hot tub overlooking the bridge and harbor. It was so beautiful. - **Observations:** I may have been the only person in the city in a poncho, but I was also the only person with a dry backpack. Umbrellas are great for the office/station commute, but never would have been realistic for my 4 hour walk. I hate that pools cost extra, but I get that it‚Äôs a thing. I guess it‚Äôs better for the people who were never going to swim. *Steps:* 34,301 **Saturday** - 3 mile Rainbow Bridge run (the foot path opens at 9am or 10am depending on the season, which I‚Äôm glad I checked before I left because I had planned on going earlier). It‚Äôs quite polluted to walk/run with the traffic right there, but I love bridges and am super happy they have the option to do it on foot. - Train to Yokohama - Walking: hotel to drop bags, stadium for Baystars vs. Swallows, rose garden and Yamashita Park, red brick warehouse, hotel to make dinner out of lounge snacks - Night: Hyatt Regency Yokohama. I used a certificate to get lounge access and made it into my meals while I was staying there. Definitely an interesting combo of food items, and not what I‚Äôd chose on my own, but totally worked for what I needed. - **Observations:** I was right to be worried about this baseball game- it rained and was borderline miserable sitting in the wet, cooler temps. Borderline though- I still had fun and am glad I went and can see how that stadium would be fun in nicer weather. While still windy (30ish mph gusts) after the game, the sun came out and I *loved* walking around the waterfront areas. I used to live/work on boats so I knew I‚Äôd like Yokohama, and I was right. *Steps:* 27,710 **Sunday** - Walking: all around Yokohama, first to the Nippon Maru/Port museum (loved both), and then kind of just following my mood/the crowd. I had planned to be there during the Yokohama Port Festival on purpose and didn‚Äôt want to set a train time in advance even though longer there meant less time in Kyoto. I was also just so happy to have a warm, sunny day that I couldn‚Äôt imagine spending the peak time of it on transportation. I‚Äôm glad I found the festival and left that time free to explore. - Train to Shinkansen to Kyoto, subway to hotel- I was worried I messed something about these tickets up but I didn‚Äôt, it all worked out fine. - Walking: was feeling the pressure of 24 hours in Kyoto so I dropped my bags and immediately headed out for the evening to Sannenzaka, Ninenzaka, Yasaka, Shirakawa Canal, picnic dinner along Kamo River, Pontocho, and a main shopping street I can‚Äôt figure out the name to. - Night: Hyatt Place Kyoto. Totally fine, very quiet and so dark I got confused in the morning. - **Observations:** I imagine a Sunday afternoon is peak time, so I was prepared to stand on the Shinkansen and needed to from Yokohama-Nagoya. I would have preferred to sit, but it wasn‚Äôt bad because the ride is so smooth. Hard to see out the windows/eat though. I saw more tourists on the first Kyoto walk than my entire trip combined. I‚Äôm also a tourist, so it‚Äôs just an observation (that confirmed what I had read about, this is not a secret). *Steps:* 38,317 **Monday** - Walking: overwhelmed by options (this was the part of the trip I didn‚Äôt plan) I just started walking‚Ä¶ and kept walking. Walked from the Fushimi Inari station up the ‚Äúmountain,‚Äù to Nishiki Market, the hotel to check out, through the grounds of the Imperial Palace, to Kinkaju-ji, Higashiyama Jisho-ji, along the river to the Philosopher‚Äôs Path, back to the hotel to pick up my bag, and then to Shijo station. The total walking distance was over 20 miles. Could I have seen more things if I‚Äôd taken any other form of transportation? Yes. Am I happy I didn‚Äôt because I like walking and it was a nice day? Also yes. The hardest part was not the walk, it was having to stand on the train afterwards for half an hour. - Train to Osaka, left bags in locker - Walking- another 2.5 miles because why not‚Ä¶ just wandered around and eventually decided to eat at a place I saw recommended here (because I realized I somehow hadn‚Äôt had noodles yet) - Train to KIX - Night: Hotel Nikko Kansai Airport. So perfect- attached to the train station and airport terminal. Smaller than my other rooms, but I was just there to sleep a few hours and didn‚Äôt need anything more. - **Observations:** I got to Fushimi Inari at 6:45am and reached the top in about 30 minutes. At that hour there were large sections where I not only felt like, but was, the only person around. It was nice to see peace and quiet there because I had read about the crowds. On my way down later, however, it was more crowded but I felt that the light was prettier- so consider what timing would make the most impact for you. The Philosopher‚Äôs Path was wildly overrated to me (though I can see from pics how it would be pretty with blossoms). I found that walking along the river was ten times more interesting. I ran out of steam attempting to do some last-minute souvenir shopping in Osaka while it started to rain- I shouldn‚Äôt have left it that late, but it also wasn‚Äôt a huge priority for me anyway so it was fine. I got the matcha kitkats and tried one and had to stop myself from eating the whole bag before they made it back. *Steps:* 62,040 **Tuesday** 6:40am flight KIX-HND. I read that you do not need to get to the airport early for early domestic flights. I got there early anyway because that‚Äôs who I am. I really did not need to- they don‚Äôt even open security until 5:30am, but this is a habit you are unlikely to break me of. Really, nothing is going on- nothing in the lounge, and just a few fancy duty free stores are open early. It‚Äôs a nice airport though! I had wanted to use my 11 hour Tokyolayover to do a day trip to Kamakura, but I hadn‚Äôt planned anything, it was raining all day again, I had a really awkward amount of cash left, and I had started to feel a little off. I knew I wanted to leave the airport though so I found an English language movie theater in Odaiba and watched the new Mission Impossible- it was perfect (and much cheaper than home)! Going through the whole process leaving took about 30 minutes, but that was only because my passport didn‚Äôt work in the automatic scanner and I had to wait in a separate line. I used my remaining time in Haneda to use up my last cash and Suica credit at the 7-11. I do not recommend doing any souvenir shopping in Haneda that is important to you- the stores and lines were chaos‚Ä¶ maybe it wasn‚Äôt a normal time but I can‚Äôt believe how few actually useful shopping places there are there (there are only so many people shopping for Hermes while waiting for a plane). Otherwise it was all smooth and my evening flight to JFK (5 of 6 for the trip with no issues) was on time. *Steps:* 21,674 - edited for formatting"}

One of my favorite aspects of travel is the journey between destinations. I love seeing the architecture and small details, decorations, landscaping, etc. That kind of thing doesn't really come through in trip reports. My wife wanted to go to Ghibli Park, and I encouraged her to do more Ghibli-related things (to make it a theme of the trip). It rained a few days, and it was really hot/humid the other days, but we had a great trip. I always try to avoid strict schedules. There were a few things that required specific reservation times. Otherwise, I had places listed by priority and proximity, and we decided once or twice a day what our next steps would be. Lower priority stuff was starred on Google Maps so I might check it out if I was in the area. Navigating with Google Maps was usually good, but it let us down a few times - especially when walking required something like a pedestrian bridge or an underground maze. There were a few times we just couldn't figure out which \"level\" to be on. Maps was great for telling which platform for a train and even the specific car to board that would let us out near the best exit. Throughout the trip, I enjoyed many onigiri, coffee, sports drinks, and snacks from 7-Eleven, Family Mart, Lawson and vending machines. We ended up at so many underground shopping malls while taking trains. It was easy to get distracted along the way. I wish I had found a few more weird items (shirts, toys, etc.) to buy, but it would have taken time. Maybe I should have researched for weird vintage shops. Things to look out for: There is no consistency of when businesses are open or closed. Could be any day or any time. Be sure to check ahead of time. In general, I love the bathrooms. But the toilet paper is very thin and soap doesn't really lather if there is soap at all. June was hot and humid. We had clear umbrellas for the rain, but a solid umbrella would have been nice in the sun (I saw one umbrella that had a clear half and a solid half). Portable fans would have been nice. Trains are usually perfect. Buses were usually 5-15 minutes late (unless I was hoping it would be late of course). Ended up using Uber/Taxis a few times to save time. It can be nearly impossible to predict when to swipe Suica sometimes. For example, buses in certain towns might expect you to swipe when getting on and off the bus. Some are a flat fare that you only swipe once. Sometimes you have to swipe in to get to a Shinkansen. Then you can use the Shinkansen ticket to exit at the destination. But if you don't also swipe out the Suica, the card will get locked and you'll have to go to a fare adjustment station. There are many little ways to get confused like that. We once got locked into the train platform. It wouldn't let us swipe out! Be careful not to get constipated! We realized halfway through our trip that we were not getting many fruits or vegetables for fiber. Plus it was hot and humid and hard to stay completely hydrated. We caught it in time and loaded up on prunes from a grocery store, but it could be a problem for anyone prone to constipation. The only purchases I regret not making were a Watchman shirt from the show I saw at UrBANGUILD (and some of the venue's signature chopsticks) and more snacks to give as gifts (and a few more for myself). I grabbed quite a few chocorooms, grape candies, and Super Mario gummies - but I should have gotten more. I also wish I had a few more of the sake \"juice boxes\" (complete with straw). I tried to be prepared for the tax-free procedures, but I found out there was like a 5,500 yen minimum which I never really exceeded at one store. I didn't see how to do anything about it at the airport either. I'm still confused about that whole tax-free thing. I'd recommend trying to leave the last day open if possible. Then you can maybe do something you missed or can take time shopping for stuff you didn't want to carry around the whole time. There are a lot of abandoned umbrellas. I wonder where they all go. Consider trying to find one opposed to buying one if you see rain in the forecast. I could tell some Japanese people were skeptical if I approached, but often the attitudes changed to smiles once I tried speaking Japanese. Try to learn some basic polite phrases, and have your question translated and ready to ask in Japanese. Then use the app to continue conversation if needed. Craft the most simple concise way to ask your question. Japanese make an \"x\" with their arms/hands to mean \"no\" when Americans would shake our head, so I started doing that when appropriate. Jet lag was pretty wild the 2nd day after getting back to the US. I was mowing at what would have been 4am in Japan and my body felt like Jell-O. Then I slept for over 12 hours lol. Oh, right before I we said goodbye to my friend at Shinjuku Station, a guy walked by wearing a string thong that barely covered his bits. His torso was covered, but he was basically naked from the waist to his shoes."}

Can't say thank you enough for all of the tips and experiences shared here! Hydrangea season in Japan is super underrated, and the rain didn't bother us much. But the summer heat was punishing, especially once we arrived in Kyoto, and this is coming from someone who has lived in Texas my entire life as an outdoorsy person. We got through the day by drinking lots of Pocari Sweat (available at any konbini or vending machine), staying in the shade as much as possible and using umbrellas as parasols, slowing our walking pace, and taking a midday break indoors. Below is what we experienced while in Tokyo, Kyoto, and and Hakone, and I wouldn't have skipped any of it: June 10: Asakusa * Senso-ji * Nakamise Shopping Street * Asakusa Culture Tourist Information Center (8th floor observation deck) * Tokyo Skytree June 11: Odaiba * teamLab Planets TOKYO * hydrangeas at Square Park of Water * Unicorn Gundam Statue * DiverCity Tokyo Plaza (Ghibli Store, GU) * Statue of Liberty-Odaiba June 12: Harajuku/Shibuya * Meiji Jingu * Takeshita Street * Shibuya Station Hachiko Statue * Shibuya Scramble * MEGA Don Quijote Shibuya June 13: Shinjuku * Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden * 3d Cat Cross Space Shinjuku * Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building Observatory * Tokyo Night &amp; Light in Citizen's Plaza June 14: arrival in Kyoto * Vintage clothing shopping (Pink, JAM, Grass) * Nishiki Market June 15: * Kinkaku-ji * Nijo Castle June 16: Arashiyama, Gion * Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, Kameyama Park Observation Point * Tenryu-ji Temple * Arashiyama Monkey Park * Yasaka Shrine * Hanamikoji St June 17: * Fushimi Inari Taisha * Uttoco Marche (flea market) * Kyoto Museum of Crafts and Design June 18: Nara * Nara Park * Kasuga Taisha * Naramachi Koshi-no-le * Walk in Naramachi: enfleur stationery shop, Goryo-jinja Shrine, Sarusawa Pond * Nakatanidou (mochi) June 20: Hakone * Hakone Ropeway * Kuratomago House (Owakudani Station) * Hakone Open-Air Museum As others have said, expect 15k-20k step days with lots of stairs with an itinerary like this one. My Brooks Ghost Max 2 shoes served me well, and still felt comfortable at the end of the trip. We stayed in Asakusa, so we ate most of our meals in Tokyo there. Favorite restaurants in Asakusa: Nook. Cafe, Kanoya (udon), Sushi Edomaru, February Cafe Favorite restaurants in Kyoto: Nakau (chain udon), Cafe Imaya, Gion Duck Noodles, Arashiyama Nomura (negiyaki and shaved ice), fiveran (bakery) We booked hotels through Expedia and had no issues whatsoever. All 3 hotels were excellent in terms of service and location: Mimaru Tokyo Asakusa Station, Mimaru Suites Kyoto Central, and Hakone Ashinoko Hanaori. The Mimaru Hotels in particular were great because we were able to get small apartments in which we could all stay together as a family. Wishing everyone safe and happy travels to Japan!"}

We just got back from our vacation in Japan. Tips I found in this subreddit have been helpful in organising the trip, so I decided to give back with my share of thoughts, reflections and memories. There‚Äôs a summary at the end. Suica (on an iPhone): worked flawlessly except for Kawaguchiko. This was strange because neither of us could use it on a bus from Mt. Fuji Station to Kawaguchiko Station nor on a sightseeing bus around Lake Kawaguchi. First time it happened we only had a 10 000 bill and the driver refused to accept it, luckily a local couple helped us out and exchanged it. Recharging didn‚Äôt work a few times around Kansai, had to do it again in a few minutes. Apart from that, it was also useful for shopping, vending machines (especially those which didn‚Äôt accept cards) and even some public parks and recreation. Crowds (Tokyo): I‚Äôve seen many posts about bad it supposedly is, but if you‚Äôve ever visited any popular tourist spot in a major city, you‚Äôll not be surprised. Have you ever ridden a metro in Rome? Here the congestion is the same, the difference is people‚Äôs behaviour. Here everyone is quiet, either on a phone or resting, no one is pushing you or trying to rob you just before the doors close (I speak from experience) and there is an order on a platform. You didn‚Äôt make into this train? You wait in line for the next one. Once, during afternoon rush hour in Akasaka, we saw bigger-than-usual queues and there were pushers (oshiya) on a stand-by. Same applies to JR lines (we have specifically chosen Yamanote Line during afternoon rush hour to have a comparison). One day stood out: we rode almost the entire Hanzomon Line to Tokyo Skytree and it was nearly empty, and only after we later made it to Nakamise-dori (the street leading up to Senso-ji) we saw what we can actually call a crowded place. Also the Tokyo Skytree was the only place where we had to wait longer than 5 minutes: we arrived at 10:30 AM and queued for 20 minutes (judging by the queue barriers, they are prepared to handle a lot longer lines), but by the time we got to the kiosk, the 11:00 AM combo tickets were sold out (there were plenty for the lower deck only). We picked the next available slot for 11:30 AM, but we were told to exit the line as our time has not yet come - fair enough. Turns out they make you queue once again, by going through the main entrance, this time in a different line with those who have their tickets reserved but not yet picked up, which is nonsense, because there is no separation right until you reach the kiosks (we skipped them). After they let you in, you form another line to the security gates (another couple of minutes) and then you queue for the elevators which in our case took another 20 minutes. After all, we made it to the first deck at 11:45 AM and spent and hour and a half altogether, including coffee with the view. Crowds (Kyoto): the subway and various railways were not badly congested. The main streets seem to be a little bit crowded, but nothing serious. The tourist spots were packed, indeed. The first 5-10 minutes into Fushimi Inari-Taisha there is a sea of people wanting to take a picture for their online followers. The higher you go, the more they disappear until you have the orange gateways for yourself. Kiyomizu-dera, Sannenzaka and Ninenzaka are crowded, as well, but have you ever walked Oxford Street in London? You get the idea. We deliberately avoided the bamboo forest in Arashiyama, having learnt in this subreddit that it‚Äôs just not worth the trip. The Hankyu Raikway going from Kyoto to Osaka-Umeda turned out to be a great and cheap service, with a limited express costing 410 yen and the journey taking just 45 minutes. A popular choice, judging by the number of passengers, so if you happen to be in its proximity, it might be a better solution than JR‚Äôs Thunderbird (even though it‚Äôs 20 minutes faster, you still have to commute to downtown). For a city much larger, Tokyo was simply quieter, more peaceful and harmonious than Osaka. Hardly anyone talked on a subway, there was an order to walking down the street or through railway stations, the locals seemed friendlier and more people spoke English (which is limited everywhere, anyway). Osaka felt grungy compared to Tokyo. While we enjoyed the walk through downtown and a visit to the castle, and Dotonbori was as colourful and loud as advertised, we feel like we wouldn‚Äôt miss that much if we decided to skip it. If someone is struggling to fit Osaka in their itinerary, devote your time to Kyoto and Nara, they offer more, as in something different, if you follow the Golden Route. Tokyo vs. Osaka is a no-brainer. You‚Äôll need cash even in some touristy spots (e.g. Sannenzaka), but you‚Äôll be surprised to be able to pay contactless in some off-the-beaten-path places (e.g. a lovely pastry shop in Arakawa City). Cash is almost always necessary in shrines and temples - if you collect goshuins, it‚Äôs a must. For 15 days we needed roughly 70 000 yen in cash (paid with card whenever possible). Seven Bank ATMs take no fee for a Mastercard debit card all day long - just make sure your bank does the same (the ones allowing you to open additional currency accounts are the best - all you have to do is to have the desired amount exchanged in-app and you‚Äôll never have to worry about finding a currency exchange office which thrive on poor exchange rates; whatever you do, make sure to block DCC and Surcharge in your settings). Fuji Excursion train is a great alternative for someone who is not fond of riding a bus, but there is no way of getting tickets ahead of time (they sell out weeks ahead and you never know the weather), thankfully you can get on it without the supplementary ticket and the conductor will sell it at a normal price (for clarity, just show you tapped with Suica at the station). We took the 7:30 AM and it was fairly crowded (no chance of sitting down unless it‚Äôs a floor), but it was slightly worse on our way back (3:00 PM) - again, not the worst crowd we‚Äôve ever witnessed. Navigating through Shinjuku Station wasn‚Äôt as bad as I‚Äôve read here: it took as maybe 5-7 minutes to reach the right platform from the Marunouchi Line (we knew the platform number, so maybe additional three minutes might be needed for those not prepared). It is a two-hour long trip one way, quite possibly standing (we ultimately sat maybe for 1/4 of the way, as not everyone in the designated cars was going all the way), but it wasn‚Äôt the only time we had to stand and the experience was absolutely worth it. You probably already know the food is good, so there is nothing to worry about digestion-wise. While it‚Äôs sensible to bring the essential medicine, we also brought some supplements in case of a bad stomach bug or worse. It was completely unnecessary, we kept ourselves hydrated with Pocari Sweat and smoothies from 7-Eleven. No aching, no illness or discomfort for half a month. You also probably heard about the lack of garbage cans on streets. It‚Äôs true, but I‚Äôll let you in on a little secret: every 7-Eleven, Family Mart or Lawson has them. And they are everywhere (all right, the vending machines are even more easily available). Even more wholesome was when we finished our meal and the personnel saw us carrying the empty package, often they took it away for us (without us asking for it). We did 20 kilometres per day on average. Surely you can do less, but we walked the entire Chuo-dori and explored the shops, strolled down the Sumida or went through cedar forests on our way from Kurama to Kibune. Some metro transfers were as easy as going 10 meters straight, some required hundred of meters of walking, so by the time we got to our first point of interest, we sometimes had already done a few thousand steps. We didn‚Äôt have those fancy Onitsuka Tiger shoes a lot of people seem to be crazy about (yeah, their stores were hugely popular), we relied on our trusted sneakers. But I‚Äôll give credit where credit is due: Shupatto bags are handy and I‚Äôm glad I read about them, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have bought them. Shinkansen: no need to book in advance, plenty of seats for two people next to each other on a weekday morning from Tokyo to Kyoto. However, on a Sunday evening, the queue for unreserved cars in Hiroshima back to Kyoto was substantial. Not only people were standing in the corridors, but many were left on the platform. We saw the same at Kobe and Osaka stations. Make sure to have a reserved seat (you‚Äôll have to wait a little bit at the kiosks) or prepare to queue, but even then you‚Äôll not be guaranteed a seat. Speaking of Hiroshima: we booked our tickets for the Peace Memorial Museum in advance via Klook for a late entry, hoping to avoid the crowds. Ultimately, we arrived an hour earlier (4:30 PM), so we asked if we can go in now, because there was no real congestion. There was no problem with it and we spent a good 2 hours on a normal pace. Surely, we didn‚Äôt have the museum for ourselves, but the lines were moving fairly smoothly. We still skipped a temporary exhibition downstairs, so I‚Äôm not sure how we would do it in 1,5 hours (the museum closes at 7 PM). Anyway, by far the cheapest museum we‚Äôve ever visited and surely one of the most significant. eSIM: we chose Ubigi over Airalo due to recent fraud reports and their supposedly good coverage thanks to being owned by a Japanese telecommunications company. The installation and activation were very easy. We chose 10 GB and 20 GB for half a month (so had to buy 30-day plans) and with having most of my research done prior to coming to Japan, me being the navigator, I only used 9,5 GB from my bigger plan. My significant other used all the data, as we streamed a movie towards the end. My fair warning: data usage differ when watching a stream and a live stream; the latter can consume your data amazingly fast, so better watch out. How was the service? Mediocre at times. Apps took significantly longer to load (10-15 seconds instead of instant), iMessage took from instant to 15 minutes (!) to be delivered with a good signal (text, not to mention photos). On the other hand, I could watch YouTube Music on the Tokyo subway or had a video call on WhatsApp with no issues at all, so I‚Äôm not sure what score to give. Various JR passes can be bought in Japan without having to do anything online prior to coming to the country. We wanted to buy Kansai-Hiroshima Area Pass (which pays off with a single round trip to Hiroshima), so I checked online and it said (still does) you can buy it at the NTA TiS Shin-Osaka Branch. This is wrong and I have not purchased the tickets at this travel agency. They sent me upstairs where I found a JR ticket office next to the Shinkansen Central Entrance. Without further delay, we presented our passports and purchased the passes which were used across the whole region without major issues (once or twice the outgoing gate wouldn‚Äôt less us through; changing the gate always worked). We were going to store our baggage in one of the lockers at Shin-Osaka Station, but after finding two places with no free space at all just after noon, we decided not to wander around and use a baggage storage facility at said station (they offer their service until 11 PM unlike the travel agency mentioned before where they close at 7 PM). It was 1000 yen for a backpack / small suitcase and 2000 yen for a large suitcase. We opted against luggage forwarding, because we didn‚Äôt mind hauling our luggage and it was convenient to have access to it at all times, not having to pack earlier and send it before our departure. The second time, at Osaka Station shortly after 10 AM, we found quite a few lockers available around. It was 700 yen for the large one (I believe 500 for medium and 300 for small) next to the Midosuji North Gate (1F). What we liked about this particular spot was they had a very easy system which allowed you to pay and access the lockers with your Suica and if the particular area was full, there was a station locker information for finding available space. I miss no potholes, no traffic jams, no graffiti. Hell, I miss the toilets. Once, I walked into a bathroom in a caf√© and the seat opened automatically, and started playing music (I believe there was a button for it saying ‚ÄôPrivacy‚Äô). I could not be happier at that moment. Arigato, Japan, and I hope to see you soon. TL;DR: Suica good, crowds not too bad, Tokyo &gt; Osaka, 70 000 yen cash - two people - two weeks, Fuji Excursion good, food very good, convenience stores convenient, a lot of walking, Shinkansen available, Hiroshima worth it, Ubigi mid, railway passes worth it, coin lockers sometimes available, Japan amazing."}

It's been about a week since we've gotten back and I'm finally ready to share our trip. Just to set the tone, we did 100% touristy stuff that was kid friendly since I have 2 kids (1yr and 3yr). We're also big pokemon fans. We traveled with family (13 in total) and most of our time was in Tokyo and did a 3 day break in Osaka. Day 1 - Sunday We landed in Haneda and it was pretty packed. Took a good chunk of time to get out, and we needed to wait even longer for some family that took a later flight (Only an hour later but still). We booked an airbnb in Taito that didn't allow for baggage to be delivered so we couldn't forward our baggage. We took the train, which was so difficult with everyone tired and with luggage as first timers. Definitely not doing that again. We'll take a taxi next time haha. We basically knocked out as soon as we got there. (Landed at 11am and got there at 5pm). Day 2 - Monday Everyone was up by 5am and weirdly we were wide awake. Not as tired as we thought we would be. Also why was it sooo bright outside so early! We took the early morning to discover 7eleven which of course was magical lol. We didn't have anything really planned for today because we thought we'd be dead tired and had big plans the next day. But we decided we wanted to do something so everyone kinda split up. My husband and I took the kids to a nearby park that had a little shrine nearby. It was super cute. Very quiet! Even when they brought the little preschoolers out it was pretty quiet. (I ASSUME PRESCHOOL, They came out in wagons). We decided to meet up with our group and walked to Asakusa. We went to the shrine, the DonQuixote and a bunch of the food shops nearby. All the food was so good! Day 3 - Tuesday We went to Tokyo Disneyland! It was so much fun and soo baby friendly. I feel like their baby centers are way more abundant and clear than the one in California. I was always able to find a place to go inside to change my kids and feed them. And the food??? So good! Baymax Burger was super cute! The lines were pretty long but kids rides are pretty fast moving so it was fine. We were also there while they were celebrating Donald Duck's birthday so we saw a bunch of parades regarding him. They really liked him hahaha. We ended up taking a taxi to and from here and oof that was a pretty penny. We decided if we REALLY thought we needed a taxi we'd do it but we really needed to learn the train. I think I was just avoiding to take the train with our big group lol. Day 4 - Wednesday Rest day! We went to Costco and I bought some clothes. Our family was suffering some crazy culture shock and wanted to make familiar food. I kept getting side tracked with the clothes. Mostly for my boys. My youngest was turning 1 the next day so we also got a cake. And of course I had some chowder from the food court lol. My husband went fishing with the guys in the group. He said he was able to buy a fishing license in the shop he went to and the guy who worked there even gave them some ideas where to go fish. Even old men passing them by would tell them what kind of fish were in the waters. Later that night Day 5 - Thursday Tokyo DisneySea! I think we liked this one even better than Disneyland. The food basically had a little bit of seafood everywhere and my husband and I were obsessed. We LOVED the little mermaid area. That was so cool. My boys did too! We were noticing that the gift shops there and Disneyland had lots of different type of merch than in the US. Like towels! LOTS OF TOWELS. Hand towels, Big towels, face towels, children's hooded towels, kitchen towels. Picnic mats, chopsticks, dishware, oh and LOTS of snacks/ chocolates. Very pretty and intricate designs. And I just loved the little preview cases they did for food. I loved seeing how the snacks/chocolates were supposed to look. They even did this for the restaurants it was so convenient. DAY 6 - Friday We took the morning to celebrate my youngest since his birthday back home was this day. Let him get all caked up and everything. We then headed out to Akihabara but all the shops where we got off were not very Stroller friendly. Or at least the shops our group was going around. Lots of stairs with little to no elevators. And it was raining so I was getting tired of waiting outside with my boys. So we split from the group and walked to Shibuya. Did the Shibuya Crossing. Went to Uniqlo, and then did our first Pokemon Center. That was super exciting lol. We took the train home and it was finally starting to make sense to me lol. Day 7 - Saturday We took the Bullet Train to Osaka! It was pretty comfy! The seats were more spacious than I thought they'd be? The time passed quickly and we did pretty decent job navigating the trains from here. When it was just me and my husband and kids, we did just fine. I ended up finding the option on Google to put on accessible directions to elevators and stuff that day to help us out with our strollers. We got situated in our Airbnb and went out to a ramen place nearby and it was amazing of course. We made a bit of a faux paux though and accidentally stayed a bit after they started closing. Back home some ramen places do the closing during mid day but I usually see the times on Google, I didn't see it this time! We were apologetic and left immediately. Day 8 - Saturday Universal Studios Japan! We met my uncle there and had lots of fun. Of course I loved the food, but it was here that I was confused about their spicy food. It wasn't spicy??? We're Mexican American so we're used to spicy. I thought the Japanese were too but my uncle told me otherwise. I was genuinely shocked lol. The Peanuts are bigger out there than I thought as well. I've never seen so much Snoopy merch! And I loved all the cute Hello Kitty stuff. The food was cute and good! And they were doing Easter Stuff???? IN JUNE???? That tripped me up a lot lol. I asked my uncle why and he said it's not a holiday there so the time isn't important. WELP lol. Nintendo World was amazing! It looked so good and my husband was so hyped for DonkeyKong, everything looked amazing and the rides really fit the individual games. But it was PACKED. Mario,Luigi and Toad came out and that was pretty cool! Day 9 - Monday Honestly sad we didn't spend more time in Osaka. We went the rest of our family off to the shikansen to head back to Tokyo early. My husband and I went and dropped off our bags at a baggage holding place and went out to eat some Duck Ramen. SUPER good! Then we went to the Pokemon Center nearby. Kinda bummed we didn't have enough time to go to the other pokemon center but we kept getting lost in the mall. Took the Shinkansen back to Tokyo! Vowed I'd stay in Osaka longer next time we came. Day 10 - Tuesday Made the treck to Sanrio Puroland. This one was mostly for me lol. And I loved it. Not a lot of rides or anything but i really liked the merch lol. And omg the cafeteria area actually had REALLY good character food!!! The train back was pretty relaxing we almost fell asleep lol Day 11 - Wednesday Rest Day! At least until late. We got some of the girls to watch our boys while my husband and I went out to eat. Everything we kept getting to go to was closed but we finally found this little place that you paid a machine first and got tickets and it was super customizable. Honestly my favorite place. It was like ramen but without the broth. The server told us we needed to mix the noodles in a sauce that would be pooled at the bottom before eating. It was so savory and UGH I don't know where I can find anything like it back here I might actually go crazy. After eating we walked it off by going all the way to Ueno station. Looked like a lot of bars around there so we walked by and then circled back and walked back to the airbnb. Day 12 - Thursday We went back to Asakusa to rent kimono!! It was a super cool experience. We walked around and ate all the taiyaki we could find and of course sweets too. Once we changed out, we headed to Tokyo Skytree. We didn't go all the way to the top. Some people in our group got reservations to the Kirby Cafe so we walked around the shops, did the Pokemon Center, saw a Ghibli pop up, ate food, bought stuff from a Bakery. They have this really cool play area for kids we stayed at for like a hour. My oldest loved it so much it was so hard to get him to leave without crying haha. We wanted to go back just me and my husband but we never got to! Day 13 - Friday Rest day! Took the boys to another park. This one seemed a bit bigger. Otherwise a pretty lazy day. Day 14 - Saturday We went to the Imperial Garden and we could not for the life of me find the Imperial Castle or the Edo Ruins. They were either blocked or that wasn't the actual entrance. Kinda bummed I didn't have more time to figure that out. Went nearby to the Pokemon Center, ate some ramen, then went to Akihabara to go to the Lafayette to check out the Sailor Moon store. Then we found a place that did lobster rolls and that was pretty good too. Day 15 - Sunday Went back to the area from yesterday to do the Pokemon Cafe and loved every second. My oldest was really into Pikachu dancing it was super cute! The food was good too! Day 16 - Monday My husband spent all day finishing with the guys trying to catch SOMETHING. ANYTHING. He had no luck at all in Tokyo. Went to a bunch of spots. Super sad. While he did that, Me, some girls and my boys went to Ikebukuro. We used a pretty old looking station. It was kinda small but you could see a bunch of train tracks and lines. It was actually kinda pretty. We went to the Animate store, the Pokemon Center, the mall and ate a bunch of food. Found out about my husband's awful luck when we got back lol. My poor husband. We also went back to that one noodle place We went to a while back. The guy recognized us! He was more open to talking to us this time around too. I just had to have those noodles again before we left. Day 17 - Tuesday We were getting ready to go home so we made some souvenir trips to Asakusa. The same shops we saw the first time around, but also stopped on this street that had a bunch of cooking / kitchen stuff. My husband loves to cook and got himself some Japanese knives he's been eyeing from their online store. They're really pretty and I'll never touch them hahaha. My husband and I went out later by ourselves to and izakaya and had some amazing food. Grilled fish, sushi, curry, crab croquettes. It was right next to our Airbnb too! Day 18 - Wednesday This was our last day and we just finished packing, getting snacks and just spending money on our Welcome Suica cards lol. The airport good was so good though??? So many great options. I feel like Tokyo was a good starter city. Everything has an English menu or translation. Even the trains translate to English. And there is just so much to do there. For our next trip there (which we're already planning!!) We want to go to Okinawa and Osaka and focus on that area next. Do Nara, Kyoto, Nagoya... We had a great time. LOVED the food, MISS the food. All the ladies loved my boys. Especially my youngest. The flowers there were so pretty and ... flat?? But it was beautiful!!! Like their flowers were TOO perfect looking. And even though it was late May- June, the weather was great! We don't get a lot of rain back home so we loved it. And it wasn't hot at all like it is here now. There were some sunny days too and even those days were pretty good. One thing I forgot to mention was even the malls there had baby feeding areas! Nothing like back home! I didn't need my cover at all. I could easily find a feeding area to feed my baby. I guess if there's any questions go ahead and ask I know I was all over the place trying to make this post make sense while writing it. I was just so excited and ended up remembering all the things we did and yeah just amazing. I can't wait for next time."}

It was 18 days stuffed to the brim with all sorts of things we all wanted to do. My Process: I made a list of all the big things that I wanted to do in Japan and entered them into a google calendar. I then figured out what days were ideal for each event and started moving them around and figuring out what order we would visit each destination. After assigning the big items, I searched for other things in nearby areas to fill out each day. In the end it worked out really well, because I made sure to put plenty of time for each event and also blocked out sections of each day specifically for transit (which I looked up on google ahead of time) I'm sure many people would be appalled at how fast we went through things, but I feel like we spent plenty of time on the highlights and only ran out of time for the \"filler\" stuff (which I plan to come back for!) Mornings are good times for trains, since everything opens 9 or 10 am in most areas. I would recommend attending at least one festival if you can (Shizuoka Matsuri was my favorite) Fri March 22nd -Arrive at Haneda Airport after sundown **Take train to Shibuya -Enjoy Scramble Crossing &amp; Hachiko -Explore alleyways and people watch -Don Quijote Sat 23rd -8:45am Travel Service Center in Shibuya #Because I had our whole trip planned out with strict travel times, we were able to print out and buy all our shinkansen tickets for the entire trip here #I was able to give the worker there the times I wanted to leave and arrive along with the station names (looked it all up in google) and she was able to pick out the correct lines and let me select which times we wanted. #I would highly recommend people do the same with their shinkansen trips as we never had to worry about tickets selling out, trying to find the right kiosk, or not having enough time before the train leaves ** Train to Shinjuku 9:30-9:50 -Get lost in Shinjuku Station #This place is an eldritch being beyond all comprehension, and pretty much the only place where we got truly lost. -Walk to Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building to enjoy view of the city for free **Train to Odaiba -Exploring DECKS mall and views in the marine Park **Train to Nakano -Explore Nakano Broadway -Play games at Namco Nakano arcade -Reservation at Bar DIO (JOJO theme bar) Sun 24th -Hanazono Shrine and Antique Market #I would equate this to a sort of \"flea market\", it was pretty fun to see what people had for sale and got some neat items -Walked through Shinjuku &amp; took pictures of the Godzilla Head -SAMPO Museum of Art #I made a point to set aside time for this museum primarily for the famous \"Sunflowers\" painting. At the time they were also showing off some very interesting Northern European pieces. -Watched the Rockabillies dance-off at Yoyogi Park -Cat Cafe -Takeshita dori -Godzilla Store -Kabukicho Tower for \"ichiban kuji\", arcade, and drinks !Ota Museum of Art was closed, so we missed out on that Mon 25th **Train out of Tokyo to Karuizawa (I happened upon a blog talking about the waterfall and turns out this town makes for a nice half day trip) **Bus to Shiraito Waterfall -Shiraito Waterfall is really cool. It is not notable for its height, but for its panoramic view and trickling of ground water -Lunch at Kawakamian, one of the highest rated Soba shops in Japan -Dessert at Mille Mele for their \"best apple pie in the world\" (a very good apple pastry) **Train to Yamanochi -Enjoyed Ryokan &amp; multi-course dinner -Took a short stroll around town to see the river and take pictures of the hotels -Rented out a larger public onsen for an hour #Those I went with were not keen on onsens with strangers, otherwise we could have easily stayed for one more day to do onsen hopping. Tue 26th -hike up a trail to the snow monkeys **Train to Obuse -Went to the Hokusai Museum (very enjoyable) **Train to Nagano -Shopping for Ekiben #I should have scheduled more time in Nagano, as we didn't have time to see much aside for what was right next to the station. **Shinkansen to Osaka Wed 27th -Walking the philosopher's path, starting at Jishio-ji temple #We stopped at multiple different shrines/temples and shops along the way #Despite my best timing efforts, the cherry blossoms had not bloomed yet -Shijo-dori (busy shopping street) -Walked to Nishiki Market -Menbaka Ramen: yes it feels like tourist trap, but was fun and the burning shallots really did make the ramen taste different -Walked to the nearby Nijo Castle for their night-time castle lights display Thur 28th **Shinkansen to Hiroshima **Ferry to Miyajima -Enjoying the shopping streets (many of the shops were just opening at 10am) -Took pictures in front of the Floating Tori Gate -Went up to the lower observatory on Mt. Misen -We underestimated the hike and decided to go back down to town for a tea ceremony **Ferry directly to Hiroshima Peace Park -Went to the memorial hall, flame of peace, and atomic bomb dome -Walked to Okonomimura which is a multi-floor food hall with nothing but Okonomiyaki resturaunts (we managed seats, it was quite busy) **Shinkansen to Osaka Fri 29th -Osaka Castle &amp; Park -Happened upon a show with performing monkey -Osaka Museum of History -Explored the shopping streets of Shinsekai (with the radio tower in the center) -GEAR nonverbal theatre show (would recommend, no Japanese required) Sat 30th -Osaka Aquarium -Explored \"American Village\" -Sennichimae Doguyasuji (shopping street for cookware) -Arcade at Taito Station Namba -Shinsaibashi Dori (shopping street) -Ebisu Bridge -Drinking in Dotonbori Sun 31st **Train to Nara -Visited many temples, gardens and shrines -Fed the deer -Enjoyed tea at historical tea house -Caught a glimpse of the mochi pounding, but the crowd was huge so couldn't see much **Train to Kyoto -Visited Kinkakuji (Golden Pavilion) -Went to Yasaka Shrine because I knew it would be lit up at night -There just happened to be a cherry blossom festival going on behind Yasaka Shrine!

Bunraku puppetry was my favorite. **Shinkansen to Odawara Tue 2nd **Shinkansen to Hakone -Visited Hakone Main Shrine &amp; Torii of Peace **Bus to south of Lake Ashi -Hakone checkpoint Museum -We could see Mount Fuji over the lake **Pirate Ship cruise across Lake Ashi **Ropeway up to Owakudani (better view of Mount Fuji) -Went on history tour of Owakudani **Ropeway down the other side of the mountain #Did not have enough time to visit the Picasso Pavilion before closing.

I was scouring this subreddit and other travel forums for months leading up to the trip, and there's some helpful things I'd love to share, along with a general (short) overview of our time in each city. We usually had 1-2 things we wanted to get to each day, and otherwise did a lot of wandering and exploring. **Big Takeaways:** \\-Japan feels CHEAP AS HELL right now as an American tourist. We were constantly blown away. Meals for $5-7 USD, drinks dirt cheap, admission tickets for places usually 500 - 1000 yen (\\~$3.5 - $7), travel and accommodations reasonably priced too. I think too many people go to the big name Western-style hotels and only eat at places they find on Google that are especially friendly to Westerners out of fear or discomfort. Go off the beaten bath even just an inch and you'll find a very affordable country. I think flights + accommodations + transportation + everything spent on the trip added up to about $2200 for each of us. \\-Learn various \"hello\"s (Ohayo Gozaimas for morning, Konichiwa during the day, Konbanwa in the evening) and be enthusiastic about your \"thank you\" (Arigato Gozaimas!!!!). I felt nervous / unsure about trying to speak a different language, but it goes along away. I saw tons of foreigners make no attempt at speaking Japanese, just pointing at things and then mumbling a \"Thank you\" in English. I felt like the small effort we made was appreciated and it's just fun to make little connections with the employees you meet. \\-Similarly, you say \"Sumimasen\" (excuse me) when you need a server or wait staff at a restaurant. Otherwise they'll mostly ignore you. Say it when you want to order another drink, or get the bill, or have a question. It feels a little rude at first to what we're used to, but just do it confidently and you'll fit right in. \\-When all else fails, Google Translate is a lifesaver. Don't be afraid to go in somewhere that looks good just because they don't have an English menu. Pointing and saying \"Thank you\" is okay. This will lead you to some delicious places you'd never go otherwise! \\-I feel like the descriptions of IC cards I read ahead of time were overly confusing. Get a Suica card, tap it to get on trains. That's it. You can add it to your apple wallet right now from your couch and refill it with your phone. (Yes, there are special tickets needed for Shinkansen and some Limited Express trains, but, seriously, it's simple as this and our Suica worked in every city we went to). \\-Having a small bag was a lifesaver (I have This Carhartt one). Passport / cash / phone / wallet, keep your trash in there until you can find a garbage can, I even rolled up a shirt I bought and stuffed it in and one time. Bags rock! The trip: **Tokyo** (Ikebekuro) Tokyo is incredible. If you've never been, it's hard to describe. Bustling, very alive, a million different little places to explore. We loved Shinjuku (of course went to Omoide Yokocho and Golden Gai, both twice), the Meiji Shrine in Yoyogi Park, explored Sunshine City and Akihabara on our rainy day, and the Ghibli museum. We enjoyed staying in Ikebekuro as it was a cute neighborhood with good food and bakeries right off the Yamamote line, which connected us to almost everything. Just heading to new neighborhoods and getting lost is awesome. **Kyoto** (Gion) Kyoto is, also, incredible. We loved the old-time feel of Gion, getting dinner and drinks in Pontocho, wandering Nashiki market and some of the nature we got to experience here. Arashiyama monkey park and Fushimi Inari were both highlights. Yes, both required a bit of a hike, but it didn't feel like anything too strenuous for a couple in our late 20's. People make a big deal out of timing Fushimi Inari \"Just right\" - we ended up sleeping in and getting there around 9:30. There was a SEA of people at the bottom, but we climbed all the way to the top and the last third was nearly desolate. So, if you absolutely need the pictures of the empty Tori gates, I guess go at 6am, but it's not necessary. We ate at a couple amazing restaurants here - Kokodenome and Rutubo. Both highly recommended. Also - the kobe beef skewers will haunt me forever. **Nara** A day trip, of course to see the deer. They were lovely, very cute - and they bow to thank you for the crackers. Just walking around watching them is great, plus the forested walk to the shrine &amp; temple are lovely. **Osaka** Another day trip. We liked Osaka, but didn't get to experience much of it, and I think we were a little \"shopped out\" by the time we got here, so Dotonbori kind of overwhelmed us. We wandered about, checked out Osaka Castle and Yasaka Shrine, got some lunch at Tenjinbashi, and that's about it. I've heard people spend a whole week here and love it - would love to come back and dive deeper. **Shimoda** This was a pretty random pick, but we wanted somewhere off the beaten bath and a little chill. We definitely got that in Shimoda. It's a little coastal town at the end of the Izu penninsula, and we came during the sleepy rainy season. Still, we stayed at an awesome guest house with a lovely family nearby who fed us dinner one night and even helped make calls to local onsens for us to find out where we could go (mixed gender bath, plus we have tattoos). We saw one or two other foreigners while here, and it was just a great little time immersed in the local culture. Had some amazing seafood, went to the Museum of the black ship, swam in the ocean when the sun eventually came out, checked out the sea cave and ended up going to the Thousand Person Bath (Kanayaryoken). Plus we got to borrow bikes from the family and ride around the area - it felt like a jungle. We loved it. Happy to answer any questions for potential travelers, and I hope this is helpful. Enjoy your eventual trip! Edit: corrected name of Onsen in Shimoda."}

This sub was really helpful for my planning so I hope someone finds this helpful too. ***General Notes*** * I only had a carry-on bag + backpack * This was in early November so the sun set between 4-5pm. * Initially planned for this to be an autumn foliage trip. I tried my best to follow the Momiji trackers online. I might‚Äôve been a little bit early. The foliage was just beginning to change to yellows, oranges and reds during my trip. * I was traveling alone so I covered a lot of ground IMO. I also spent a lot of time walking places, averaging 20K-30K steps a day. I did not taxi/uber anywhere * I was up each day around 7-8am and would generally be on my way around 8:30am. I would end my day around sunset, then head for dinner. * I only stayed in Aomori 1 night. Spent the rest of my time living Sendai. * I used google maps and the Japan Travel app to plan out how to get around. I only planned ahead to catch specific trains in the mornings just to get my day going. I did not do this for getting between places within the same day in case I wanted to spend more time at an attraction even though maybe I should have (see day 4). ***Note on Meals:*** * I‚Äôm not really into restaurants and refuse to line up for them. I know about Tabelog but I didn‚Äôt really bother looking up restaurants beforehand. But I had an idea what the regional specialties were for each town/prefecture and tried to focus on those. I know it can be touristy but I was a tourist idc. * Keeping in mind that I was traveling solo, tapping on restaurants in google maps and trying to walk in or just eating at the restaurants in the train stations worked for me. I did get turned away at one soba place, but I wound up trying something new instead, so everything worked out. * I did end up eating convenience store meals a couple times because I was rushing to catch a train. ***Day 1: Departing Tokyo for Aomori Prefecture*** *Morning* ‚Äì Took the shinkansen from Tokyo to Hirosaki. Arrived a little before 11am. Walked to Hirosaki Castle and explored the surrounding area. Lunch at this tomato ramen spot in Hirosaki. *Afternoon* ‚Äì Hirosaki to Aomori. Check in to hotel. Spent about 2h at Nebuta Museum and A-Factory. *Evening* ‚Äì It was raining, had this scallop thing with rice and natto for dinner at one of the restaurants in the train station. Then back to the hotel for the night ***Day 2: Leave Aomori to Sendai via Kakunodate*** *Morning* ‚Äì Morning jog around Aomori. Depart for Kakunodate and arrive just before lunch. *Afternoon* ‚Äì Udon lunch at one of the restaurants in Kakunodate (it was the 2nd floor of a shop), explore the town. Leave Kakunodate around 4:00p for Morioka Station (really make sure to check the train times). Couldn‚Äôt fit Morioka into my itinerary so I really just stopped to try Morioka noodles at one of the restaurants below the train station. *Evening* ‚Äì Depart Morioka for Sendai. Check in to hotel and rest. ***Day 3: Yamadera and Arahama Elementary School Excursions*** *Morning* ‚Äì Breakfast at Sendai Station, catch the train from Sendai to Yamadera, arrive in Yamadera around 9:30am. Hiked up the steps, take in the view. Ran back down the steps to catch the train back to Sendai Station. *Afternoon* ‚Äì Lunch @ a gyutan restaurant in Sendai station around 1pm. Travel to Arahama Elementary School via bus from Sendai Station. This school doesn‚Äôt really have much nearby so beware the bus scheduling if you want to visit. This was really really cool though. *Evening* ‚Äì Back to Sendai for the evening, Gyutan restaurant for dinner + wandering + relax ***Day 4: Hiraizumi Excursion*** *Morning* ‚Äì Sendai to Hiraizumi. Arrive around 8:30am. Got a rental bicycle for the day to get around. Biked out to see Takkoku no Iwaya, then back to town to see the heritage sites. Was done by 1:30p. *Afternoon* - Lunch in Hiraizumi at the ramen shop near the train station. I had originally planned to go to Geibikei Gorge in the afternoon. Based on my research at the time, the ferry was still running, but I might have missed something and there were no more trains to Geibikei Gorge from Ichinoseki on that day. I just went back to Sendai instead. *Evening* ‚Äì Free time in Sendai ***Day 5: Touring Sendai + back to Tokyo*** *Morning + Afternoon* ‚Äì Check out of the hotel. Bought Loople Pass and boarded at around 11am for Zuihoden, Site of Sendai Castle, Osaki Hachimangu shrine, Jozenji-dori. From Jozenji-dori I spent the rest of the day on foot. Matsushima Bay was my alternative plan for this day but I thought it would have been hectic because I had to get back to Tokyo in the evening and I was tired. *Evening* ‚Äì Back to Tokyo. I didn‚Äôt reserve a seat on the shinkansen because I wasn‚Äôt sure how long I would spend touring around Sendai. Typically, I could have walked up to the JR East desk and reserved a seat using my pass. Departed the hotel around 4pm. However, it was a Friday, so due to weekend volume + service interruptions I didn‚Äôt get to Tokyo until 11pm. ***Closing Notes:*** * This was my first time visiting Japan and overall I'm really happy with how it turned out. I opted for Tohoku because due to the timing of my trip, I wanted to see the autumn foliage. I was a bit too late for Hokkaido (I think it was snowing in Sapporo at this time). I did spend time in Tokyo but I didn't write about that because there are already plenty of fantastic reports about Tokyo on here. * I did not visit as many attractions as I had initially wanted to during the early stages of planning. I‚Äôm happy with how things turned out though. * I‚Äôm happy with how my trip turned out and I don‚Äôt think I would change much if I were to do it again. But, there are a lot of places to see and things to do in Tohoku that are a bit more remote and may not be conveniently accessible by train. Renting a car would have helped a lot, and given me the the option to stay overnight in places that are not along the train lines, or even places that are along the train line but would need me to dedicate extra time to get to/from because of how remote they are. I couldn't justify paying for the rental without some friends to split the cost though. * I would have liked to see more of the Akita and Aomori prefectures and some Onsen but Tohoku is a big region and I only had 5 days with the rail pass."}

I did the first half of my trip with my dad and the second half was partly solo and partly with work friends that had a shorter trip at the tail end of mine. The amount of days and cities turned out to be a perfect pace for me. I did a lot, but it did not feel stressful. **Planning** I don't really like an daily itinerary when I travel. I prefer to save a bunch of places I want to see (from watching youtube videos) on google maps and then just go where I want to go in the moment. I still have hotels booked, so I knew which cities I would be in. Other than that and tickets to the World expo and a baseball game, i didnt have any other reservations for my trip. I tried to give myself at least one full day, with no transit, at most of the cities. My work friends had a very fast paced trip at the end of mine, and they were wiped out and tired the whole time. Even though I still did a lot on my trip, giving myself more days really cut down on the stress and tiredness. * Day 1 - Tokyo, Travel (arrive 5pm) * Day 2 - Tokyo * Day 3 - Tokyo * Day 4 - Train to Kanazawa, 3hrs * Day 5 - Kanazawa * Day 6 - Train to Takayama * Day 7 - Takayama * Day 8 - Train to Kyoto, 3hrs * Day 9 - Kyoto * Day 10 - Kyoto * Day 11 - Kyoto * Day 12 - Train to Osaka * Day 13 - Osaka (World Expo Day) * Day 14 - Osaka (Himeji/Kobe Day trip) * Day 15 - Train to Nara * Day 16 - Train to Tokyo, 3 hrs * Day 17 - Tokyo * Day 18 - Tokyo, Travel (leave 5pm) **Hotels** ***Tokyo 1*** - Prince Sakura Tower, Shinagawa. Very nice hotel. Had a very large, western style room and nice restroom. The nearby station was pretty good for connecting to the rest of the city. ***Kanazawa*** - Hyatt Centric Kanazawa. Nice hotel and more western-style large rooms. It was right next to the train station, which made it easy for arriving and leaving. Most of the toursit spots are 20-30 min walk down the road though, which still wasn't too bad, but good for some people to know ***Takayama*** - Hotel Spa and Gift Takayama. Definitely small rooms, which wasnt too bad except the restroom, which was too small to manuever in. The location was perfect though. Close to the train station, though partway to the old town. The rooftop onsen was also amazing and the best onsen of my trip. ***Kyoto*** - The Chapter Kyoto. Nice hotel with another good onsen, this one on the first floor, but still pretty. The rooms were nice and a good size. The location was pretty good. We still did a lot of Taxis, but I think thats more just because of Kyoto's transit system ***Osaka*** - Some random Bnb apartment. I didnt book it and wouldnt suggest it. It was at least clean, but it wasnt comfortable ***Nara*** - Nara Visitor Center and Inn. I wanted to try a traditional japanese style room at least once. It was nice to experience, but the hardness of the futon on tatami made me glad it was just one night. The location of the hotel is great. And its a visitor's center too, so they had an activity room that looked fun if you were into activities like Origami and writing your name in kanji ***Tokyo 2*** - APA Hotel Kayabacho. Very small room, though it was fine since it was for just me. Quality of the room was still good. It was about 5 min from a metro station, but just far enough from Tokyo station that the walk was not great (especially in the rain) **Summary** * Tokyo - Wasnt sure if I would like this city, but I did. I felt from most people it was just a shopping city, which Im not normally that kind of person, but I did enjoy checking out stores while I was there. Seeing a baseball game here was also a great experience. Shibuya sky would probably have been a better experience if it wasnt raining, and the nightlife could have been fun if I was traveling with people that liked going out to bars. Food was also very good here * Kanazawa - Cool little city with fun historic districts to see. Its a little touristy, but quite as much as places like Kyoto. I think one *full* (wakeup and sleep, not a daytrip) day is the perfect amount here. Omicho market, the geisha district (hagashiya chaya), geisha teahouse museum, castle, samurai district (nagamachi), and samurai house museum are all worth seeing and can be done in the day without rushing. I didnt love the Kenrokuen gardens, but I think that was because I had high expectations for them * Takayama - Also a place that I think one *full* day is perfect. The old town, Maturi kaikan museum, showa museum, and open air museum are worth it. Its also a good spot to get a ryokan with an onsen to have that experience * Kyoto - Definitely super tourity, but still worth visiting. You kinda just need to get accustomed to the crowds, especially for some areas. Kiyomizudera and the streets leading up to it are ridiculously crowded, but its still pretty and there are some side streets and temples nearby that are not devoid of people, but are definitely much calmer and nicer. The Golden temple you can do quick just to see it and the Arashiyama bamboo forest is also something that is cool to see, even through the crowds. And from the bamboo forest you can check out nearby Tenryuji and Okochi gardens and maybe go up the path to the monkey park that is still worth the tiring, long uphill walk. Fushimi inari is the only place I think is vital to see, despite the crowds. It doesn't really thin out much, but its still super cool to see, and if you follow the path for Ganrikisha Shrine, you should get on a path that will have much less people and sometimes even noone around you. If you have more time, or hate crowds enough to not do one of those big, popular sights, I suggest still trying to go to one of the many other temples in the city just to see them. I really liked Eikando at the end of the philosophers path myself. * Osaka - Not really my vibe for a city. It was fun to look at and walk around, but honestly I was glad I didnt give myself much time here * World Expo - Worth seeing, but it was extremely frustrating. Long lines for all the pavilions, if they even allowed people without the impossible-to-get-reservations. If you go, try to go to pavillions early before the lines and be comfortable with just walking around and looking at the cool buildings from the outside * Himeji - A very great daytrip from Osaka. The castle was super pretty from all angles while walking around and the gardens were my favorite I had seen all trip. We also stopped in Kobe on the way back and checked out the terraced herb gardens, which could be great if your legs arent super sore or if it is spring. * Nara - I liked doing this with an overnight, but I could see it being a daytrip. The deer are fun to see and I had a great time with the time I had, but I think it was tired at the end of my trip, so I didnt do much here **Food** * The Best * Kanazawa - Okina Sushi. Tiny sushi place run by a married couple and kinda hidden * Kyoto - Kamogawa Takashi. Yakiniku place with no english whatsoever. Get a multicourse meal with a bunch of different types of beef to cook over a charcoal grill in front of you. You may need a reservation, since I probably lucked out getting seated right away * Kyoto - Tendon Mentatsu. Great Tempura Place * Kyoto - Komefuku Shijo Karasuma. Medium sized Izakaya with great sushi * Tokyo - Jyotou Curry Akihabara. Probably a typical curry place, so this is just s recommendation to find a casual curry place with at least pretty good ratings for an amazing dish * Tokyo - Toriya Kou NEO. Yakitori place in the same building as Shibuya sky * Great * Tokyo - Keitei. Tonkatsu place in Ginza * Kanazawa/Kyoto - Omicho/Nishiki Markets. Either have good options to try skewers of beef or fish * Kanazawa - Ochenta y ocho. Weird little spanish tapas place on the second floor with a fun owner with very little english * Takayama - Sanbyakuryo. Izakaya that was pretty good. Had a dish where you cooked chicken and cabbage on a hot plate that was good. * Takayama - Brand New Day Coffee. It can be hard to find breakfast in Japan. Especially quick breakfast. This place has great croissont sandwhiches. * Kyoto - Udon Arashiyama-tei. Good udon place next to the monkey park entrance * Kyoto - School bus Coffee. Great coffee and great french toast * Kyoto - Shoto Cafe Kyoto. Good coffee and great short cakes * Osaka - Takoyaki at a streetcart * Osaka - Okinomiyaki Mizuno. Really good okinomiyaki with the only bad service I had in Japan **Notes** * I ordered my pocket wifi online through \"Global advanced Communications\" You just note your flight and they ship it to a spot in the airport you can pick it up. I got the unlimited plan, which worked great. The only downside was the battery life. I had to recharge it at least once, sometimes twice throughout the day. I had a portable charger for my devices anyway though, so I wasn't carrying anything extra * Google maps worked great. I used it for everything. It was great at guiding through the metro lines. Getting out of a station can be confusing though. It often had a hard time telling which side of a street you were on in the big cities. If you at least follow its suggested exit or look at what exit you are leaving through on the map is, that can help a lot. * For the metro I put an IC card on my phone wallet (Iphone only, sorry) and that was so nice and made it super easy to tap in and out of subways and add money to it.. I got a Suica and an Icoca, just to compare. The icoca was annoying because it required face recognition everytime I used it, so I just used the Suica. The card worked in all the cities I visited. * You dont need to book trains ahead of time, especially on common routes. It felt weird to me, but we would just go to the station and buy tickets right there for a train that left in 10-15min. There was only once on my trip (osaka-nara) where the next available seat was a long wait, but that seemed to be somewhat unusual * The first half of my trip I only bought tickets by going to the JR desks with real people. There was rarely a long wait, and it was especially nice for them to book trips that had connections. Later on I would use the machines, but they are a little confusing and annoying. * Besides the many questions process of buying tickets at the machine, you also need to look for the right machine. Some only sell local tickets and others sell the long shinkansen trips * Places don't often open early in Japan. A lot of places didnt open until 10am at the earliest. Im an early bird, so sometimes I couldnt do much for a couple hours * Related to the last note, breakfast can be hard to find. Im not a breakfast person, but the people I traveled with were and it was a little difficult finding places that are open early and even just breakfast places in general. * The rule about not eating/drinking and walking isnt a law, but its always there culturally. It is uncommon outside of convenience stores to find places where you are expected to take food away. You can't find trash cans often, but if you buy food at a stand, you are expected to eat it there and give them back their packaging to throw away. If you buy anything in bottles thats easy to carry, because a lot of vending machines have bottle recycle cans next to them * There is no set rule about what side of a path or sidewalk you should walk on. This annoyed me a lot. At first I thought it was just because tourist always walk on the wrong side, but I saw many locals walking on either the left or right. Most often people walk on the left side, especially in train stations. * If someone is motioning you to come to them or a construction worker is motioning you to pass by them, their hand signal looks like they are shooing you away. It caused a some confusion the first time I saw it and the first time my friend did. * This may be just me, but the Pokemon and Nintendo stores were a bit dissapointing. I ended up going to 6 pokemon stores, just because, but they all had identical stock from what I could tell and not much seemed to interest me. They have small plushies of every pokemon and larger sizes for select popular ones. Then some stationary and cards and stuff. I'm sure others could find things they like, but even as a big fan of pokemon and many nintendo properties, I only ever got one plushie at one of the nintendo stores. * The ghibli stores were a little better for me, though the one in Osaka was really small. The one in tokyo skytree was a little larger, and the one in Tokyo station was the best I saw, especially since there was a store next door called GBL that had a bunch of Proco Rosso stuff , my favorite ghibli movie **Overly Detailed Daily Recap** * Day 1 - Travel to Tokyo, arrive around 5pm * Just time to check into the hotel and get dinner at the train station * Day 2 - Tokyo * Senso-ji - fun start to the day. cool to see and do fortunes, though very busy * Walked to Tokyo Skytree. Didnt want to go up it, but just see it. We checked out some shops inside * Train to Akihabara for lunch and walking around a couple nerd shops just for the experience * Train to Teamlabs Borderless - Super cool place and especially fun since I went in without much knowledge. I got tickets the night before when I saw there were spots available. * Walk to Tokyo Tower - not a lot here, but nice to see * Passed out at the hotel due to jetlag, then had an ok dinner at the station * Day 3 - Tokyo * Train to Meiji Jingu Shrine - Liked it more than Shinso-Ji, since I liked the natural setting. It was still crowded * Walk to Tower Records - just cool to walk around a tower records store again * Scramble Crossing - just cool to pass through, but it was not something i would go out of my way to see * Shibuya Sky - Bought tickets at the counter. Because of the rain, they only had the indoor room open, which was nice and relaxing, but also not really worth the price. They were offering full refunds at the entrace, but I wish they just made the tickets half off instead * Lunch - Neo Yakiniku at the Shibuya sky building. Great meal * Pokemon and Nintendo Stores - Crazy crowded and ridiculous check out line. Just walked around to get an idea of what I may buy later in the trip * Found a cafe to chill in while we waited for the rain and wind to die down * Train up to Shinjuku Park - Pretty nice, but not amazing * Tokyo Swallows game at Meiji Jingu - Highlight for me as a baseball fan. Super fun experience. I think you still should at least not dislike baseball to enjoy a game though. Its not as crazy/weird as I think some people make it out to be. Its still baseball at the end of the day * Day 4 - Travel to Kanazawa * About a 3hr train ride to Kanazawa. Not super pretty, but comfortable and smooth * Check into the hotel in Kanazawa and head to Omicho Market for beers and skewers for lunch * Walked to the Geisha district, Higashi Chaya - Pretty area to walk around. The geisha house museum was closed early due to some tour groups arriving * Walked around the Castle a little. * Dinner at a little 2nd floor bar that turned out pretty good, but translation issues meant we only got one plate when we meant to order two * 2nd Dinner and beer at a brewery in the train station * Day 5 - Kanazawa * Light breakfast in Omicho Market * Walk to Higashi Chaya - Prettier in the sun, but also much busier. There are a lot of bus tours dropping people off here all day * Geisha house museum - Very small and a quick walkthrough, but pretty cool to see * Walked over to and around the Castle, which was pretty cool * Lunch was Acai bowls at a place near the Gardens. Was really nice on the hot day * Kenroku-en gardens - Pretty, but kinda dissapointing. The garden was nice, though not amazing, and the crowds took away from the vibe of it even more. * Walked to Samurai District, Nagamchi - The area was nice, especially the flowing canals in the streets and the traditional walled houses * Nagamachi Samurai house museum - Little larger than the geisha tea house, but still not too big. The gardens were nice and great to sit at and watch. * We checked out Oyama shrine, shich we had passed the day before. The entrance building is super cool and unique. * That was just about all the sights I had saved to see, so we were looking for some opportunities to chill for the rest of the day. * We went back to Omicho as it was starting to close up. We got some more beer and some beef skewers that were delicious * Dinner - Okina sushi was at a tiny sushi place that was amazing * Went to the pokemon store at the train station before leaving. I was the only one there, so I got a plush of my favorite pokemon (linoone) with no line at checkout * Day 6 - Travel to Takayama * Got tickets at the station for Takayama. A short shinkansen ride to Toyama, a quick lunch, and then a longer local train to Takayama * Lunch in Toyama was at some weird sake tasting room at a mall near the station. Was actually pretty good, and I got what is apparently a local dish, marinated trout over rice * The train from Toyama to Takayama was amazing for me. It was not super slow or fast, but was still a nice scenic ride through the hills * We got into Takayama and checked into our hotel. * We then walked to the old town and walked down the streets a bit. I got one of my favorite things this trip, a little pouch for coins * Dinner was at a place that had good reviews, but we did not have very good food unfortunately * After dinner we went to another brewery for drinks that was tiny, but fun * Day 7 - Takayama * Morning Markets - Pretty nice and not too crowded. We just got a pack of strawberries, which were delicious * Matsuri Yatai Kaikan - A kinda small museum housing a couple of their huge and intricately designed festival floats. Super cool to see and the little audio guide was great for info * The shrine nearby was really pretty too. * Walked down to old town. It was much more crowded today. Lots of school groups and tour buses * Takayama Showa Museum - Pretty fun * Higashiyama Teramachi - A promenade of a couple temples just outside the main city. Little calmer here, and walking up into some woods to a little shrine was nice too * Hida no Sato Open air museum - We got a bus at the main station for the open air museum. There were almost no people there, and it was really cool to see all the traditional country buildings and read the descriptions. It was also very peaceful and pretty nessled in the hills. * Took a bus back to town and got beer at a craft bar and then found an Izakaya for dinner that was really nice. * Day 8 - Travel to Kyoto * Onsen before leaving - It had been too hot to do the onsen until this morning, so we did it now. It was my Dad and I's first onsen experience, so we were a bit nervous, but it was great and we felt relaxed after. * Another long train in the hills to Kyoto. Also very pretty. We transfered at Nagoya to a shinkansen for the last leg to Kyoto * Got in the long taxi line at Kyoto station and went to the hotel to check in. * Lunch - We were hungry, so we went to a tempura place that a coworker who visited recently suggested. It was amazing * Walk to Kiyomizudera - We walked to the temple through the crazy crowds on all the streets of the historic districts. Before this, I thought Kanazawa and Takayama were touristy, but this was a little overwhelming. We went off the path a few times and could find some streets with less people, but it was still crazy. I got used to it after awhile, but it was still crazy * Kiyomizudera - its pretty and has some nice views. Its not my favorite and the crowds are kinda annoying, but I was still glad to see it. If you give yourself time, its worth seeing, but maybe skippable if you have a short time in Kyoto. The walk to and from the temple was still a fun experience though. Both the crazy crowded streets and the more peaceful side streets. * Pontocho - We walked through the nightlife alley on the way back to our hotel. It was daytime, but still cool to see the small street. * Dinner we had at the hotel, which was nice since we were tired * Day 9 - Kyoto * Kinkakuji (Golden Temple) - Got a taxi out here in the morning. Nice to see. Its a conveyer belt of tourists going around the temple and straight out. I dont mind doing a tourist spot like that, but I know some people arent into that kind of thing * Kitano Tenmagu Shrine - I wanted to something else before leaving, so we walked to this shrine. It was actually pretty busy, since there was some event where they were picking fruits from trees around the temple * Nishiki Market - We took a taxi back to the town center to get food at the market. We walked it and eventually got some food. Definitely larger than Kanazawa's, but not exactly better or worse * Matsui Sake Brewery tour - I had looked this place up a couple days earlier and was glad I did, since I was able to reserve a tour through email. It was a small tour, but really interesting, and the tasting after was great as well * Passed through the Imperial palace gardens on the way back. maybe it was the section we were in, but it was not not that interesting or pretty * Got beers at a little brewery that was nice * Went to an irish pub for dinner that was not very good * I walked around Pontocho looking for a fun bar. The main alleyway is pretty at night, but its not an enrgetic nightlife. Its more just dinner places that were mostly pretty quiet. The rowdier bars seem to be on the nearby streets, but I was ready to just turn in for the night * Day 10 - Kyoto * A rainy day for most of this day * Arashiyama Bamboo Forest - Went here first thing. It wasnt super early, but I still hoped to beat some crowds. I kinda did, but there is still a lot of people * Tenryuji gardens - Walked through here and it was pretty nice. A little crowded, but still a nice walk * Okochi Gardens - This was suggested by the owner of the tempura place we went to. Even though its in the middle of the bamboo forest, not many people go in. It was a small garden, but pretty and had some nice views and was nice to get away from the crowds * We walked south towards the river and the bridge. Togetsukyo Bridge was a little crazy to cross with all the tourists and umbrellas * Arashiyama Monkey Park - Did not expect to do this, but my dad was up for it, so we went up. The walk is no joke. Especially after a lot of walking on the trip, this uphill climb was tough. At least it wasn't raining while we were walking and the monkeys at the top were super fun to see running around * Lunch - an udon place at the base of the hill that was actually really good and nice for the cold, rainy day * Daihakaku Senkoji Temple - The walk here was super pretty and fairly flat. The temple itself was up a hill that kinda sucked after our climb to the monkey park. The temple was smalls, but had a little platform with a beautiful view that would have been worth it for me if I was traveling solo. It would have been a nice place to sit and read or just relax, but my dad is not the relaxing type, so we just head back right away. * We got a taxi to our hotel to change out of wet clothes and then went to a cafe, schoolbus coffee that was very nice to relax a bit. Then got some beers at the hotel to relax a bit * Dinner - Our worst dinner the night before was offset by our best. A yakiniku place near the hotel called Kamogawa Takashi * Day 11 - Kyoto * My dad was leaving this day, but not until later. And I would stay and sleep one more night in the hotel * Fushimi Inari - After Kiyomizudera and the golden temple, I was not sure I wanted to do this other Kyoto staple. I dont regret it. It was definitely crowded, and the crowds didnt actually \"taper off\" as you went further up as much as I had heard online. I did go to a specific shrine, Ganrikisha, i had heard about online, and that section was the only spot I was able to walk without people around (sometimes). Its still cool and pretty to see in general anyways. * Tofukuji Temple - Near Fushimi Inari, so I wanted to check it out. It was my first rock garden I saw and the temple was really nice and not super crowded. * We went back near the hotel and got snacks and coffee at a little cafe and then lunch at a brewery by the market. At this point my dad left and I was on my own * I walked through some of the shops and then to my fourth pokemon store and second nintendo store. I didnt even like these stores that much, but now I had been to a couple, so I ended up going to most of the ones I could on my trip * Dinner - Komefuku Shijo Karasuma for great sushi. A little wait, but not too long * Day 12 - Kyoto, Travel to Osaka * Onsen. I wish I had gone to the onsen at the hotel before now, but i was usually too tired to. It was nice though and a good way to start the day * Ginkakuji - I took a bus out to the silver temple. The temple was pretty and not crazy crowded, but was still just a set path around the garden for different views of the temple. * Philosophers Path - Starting from the north, the path was a little dissapointing at the north, but it started getting prettier further south. I found a good spot to sit and read that was pretty, serene, and with very few people passing through. * Eikando Temple - This was my favorite temple of the trip. It was at tthe end of the philosophers path and was not very crowded. It was very pretty and the path through was very nice. * I headed back to the hotel, stopping by a little model shop and a shop I stopped in the day before for some plastic and paper model kits. * The train to Osaka was quick and I went to the apartment my work friends had booked to drop off my stuff * Dontonburi - We were somewhat near this area, so we walked down there, looking for food. The area was vibrant and fun, but honestly so much of the area was full of ads for host and hostess bars, that it didnt seem like an actual fun place to drink * Okinomiyaki - We got in line at a place, Okinomiyaki Sanpei, that was really good, though the server was very obviously annoyed with her job, which felt weird compared to the other service i had received in japan * Dessert - My workmate had specific food places in mind and so we went to this parfait place they wanted to go to. It was good, though a little pricey. The parfaits looked amazing and tasted good though * Day 13 - Osaka * We got a japanese style breakfast near our lodging that was pretty good and went to the expo grounds right after * The expo was packed. It didnt take long to get in, but there were a lot of long lines in. * The inside was not much better. In hindsight we should have gotten in some of the lines we saw in the morning, because as bad as they looked they only got worse as the day went on * We went in two pavilions at first, Spain and Indonesia, that didnt have long lines. Both were pretty cool * Then we got a pretty nice sushi box lunch at a little food court thing * Lines seemed really long now, so we just walked around the grounds. Lines only got worse, so we only really stopped into some pavillion's cafes for snacks. A lot of pavillions were either reservation only (and those reservations were impossible to get), super long lines, or sometimes they just closed the walk-in lines temporarily. * the only reservation my friend was able to get before the expo was Netherlands, with was boring and bad * We then did one last pavilion, Australia (which was pretty good), before my friends left to nap at the hotel * I stayed and tried some pavillions with short lines. Qatar (ok) and Singapore (pretty good). I wanted to get some merchandise, but the line just for the stores were super long and not worth it to me. * Overall the world expo was really annoying, but I was still glad I went. The pavillions were still cool to see from the outside and the one we did see inside were interesting. Temper your expectations of seeing multiple pavillion interiors and just go planning to walk around the cool buildings * My friends had made reservations for the Teamlabs botanical gardens, so I went straight there from the world expo to meat them * Teamlabs botanical gardens - Not good. Pretty boring and sparse. Really disapointing * Day 14 - Osaka * I had suggested doing a daytrip to Himeji this day if we were up for it. With how tired we were the night before, I was surprised that we were all up for it in the morning still * Took a train to Himeji and walked from the station to the castle * Himeji Castle - super cool and worth it to see from the outside. Crazy photogenic from many angles. The tour inside the castle grounds was nice too, though the actual inside of the castle was pretty boring and bare. * We went to a cafe nearby to get some food to tide us over, which was nice though a little too filling for what we needed in the moment * Kokoen Gardens - These were my favorite gardens of the trip. When I got tickets for the castle, there was an option to get a combo with the gardens and I said sure. Im glad I did. They were very nice and it went on pretty long through many types of gardens. Very recommended * One of my workfriends and I were ready to just go back to Osaka and chill, but the other really wanted to go to a terraced garden thing in Kobe, so we headed there * Kobe Nunobiki Herb Garden and Ropeway - The entrance to this was pretty close to the train station, so we got off and went straight to the gondola station. The ride up the hills was pretty and the views over kobe were nice, but the terraced gardens looked too daunting for our sore legs. We ended up chilling at the top for a while with some beers, which was nice, and then eventually decided to do the walk down to the lower gondola station. It was pretty, and could be a nice place to visit for some people, but I wouldnt say this was a must do. And it wasnt good for people who were already super tired and sore * Dinner - we took a train to downtown Kobe and went to a sushi place for dinner. The food was really good, even if their translated menu was really difficult. The vibe in Kobe was young and fun, but we were just passing through * After dinner we got back on the train for Osaka. My friends went straight to the hotel, but I had a burst of energy and I wanted to see Osaka at night * Shinsekai - I hadn't been to this area yet and wanted to check it out. There were definitely people and bars and fun shopfronts, but it was still dying down pretty early around 8. The most interesting things was there were a lot of shopfronts that were little carnival games mixed in with the restaurants. * Dontonburi - Since there wasnt anything in shinsekai I wanted to do, i headed back to Dontonburi. Really the main thing I was looking for was Takoyaki, which I hadnt had yet. I found a stand that looked good and was able to get some that was pretty good. The area was lively and fun, mostly tourists trying streetfood and walking around, but it was still fun to see before going back to our hotel to sleep * Day 15 - Travel to Nara * I wanted to get to Nara early, but this was the first time buying tickets morning of didnt work well. The only tickets i would give me werent for a couple hours. So I put my bags in a coin locker and found a nice, kinda hidden, starbucks to sit and read at for a bit * The train to Nara was not that pretty, but was a fine ride. Pretty quick to get there * I walked to my hotel to drop off my bags and explore. Unfortunately I immediately saw that the big pagoda was covered with a shed for refurbishment. That really took away from nara for me because it poked its head up around several spots around the park * I walked through Nara park and saw all the deer. There really are tons of them. And they were very aggressive, biting at people who ran out of crackers or were trying to save them for other deer. I didnt get any crackers, but it was fun to see and I just walked past all the people and deer in the park * Lunch - I went to a place recommended by a yourtuber called Maguro Koya that was really delicious. They are known for tuna and you could tell they normally get long lines, but I was there at a weird time for lunch, so I got seated quickly * I didnt feel like walking a lot or going to another temple, so i went to a garden, hoping to find a place to relax. I originally walked to Isuien Gardens, since i had it saved, but it looked like just another tourist treadmill and I wasnt in the mood for that * Yoshikikien Garden - This was a free garden I saw near Isuien garden and decided to check it out. It was great. Almost noone was going in here, so I found a nice spot on a porch overlooking the gardens to read for a long time in mostly-quiet calm surroundings * I was a little hungry and still had some time before my hotel check in, so I went to a brewery for snaks and beer that was pretty good * Dinner - After fully checking into my hotel and relaxing in the room a bit I went to a brewery to get beer and a light dinner since I wasnt very hungry. It was fine, but nothing amazing. * Day 16 - Travel To Tokyo * I originally thought it would be good to have a morning in nara, so I could walk around early before a lot of the people who come for daytrips arrive, but I felt like just leaving for Tokyo as early as possible. I got a train ticket and headed out in the very early morning * There was a connecting local train to Kyoto and then about a 3hr shinkansen to Tokyo. I got a bento at Kyoto station and had a nice smooth ride up to Tokyo. I saw most of Mt fuji on the way up, with just the very top covered in clouds * It was rainy and windy in Tokyo. I went straight to the hotel and dropped off bags. * I met back up with my workfriends and we went shopping at a couple places in Ginza, which was ok, but it turned out to be a neighborhood I didnt really like. Lots of luxury stores and food and cafe options near us didnt look like what we wanted either. * We split up for a bit while my workfriends did some sort of Tea cocktail experience and then met up for dinner, which was nice. We then went out for drinks after at a brewery * Day 17 - Tokyo * Tsukiji Market - Got some sushi for breakfast and left pretty quickly after. It was crowded, and with the rain and umbrellas it was not fun walking through there * Tokyo station - After stopping at a cafe for a bit, I went to tokyo station for the ghibli and pokemon stores. I found some stuff I really liked at GBL, some sort of ghibli store next to the official ghibli store. They had a lot of Proco Rosso stuff, which is my favorite ghibli movie, so it was perfect for me * I then went up to akihabara for a couple model stores that were interesting, but didnt really have what I was looking for * Lunch - Got lunch at a quick and casual little curry place that actually turned out amazing. Then walked around and chilled/read at a cafe. * Dinner was just some light snacking at a bar I found * Golden Gai - I wanted to see this little district, even though I wasnt in the mood to drink. It was still cool to see, but I wasn't in the mood to socialize, which is definitely the point of all those little bars. Still super cool and worth it to walk around * Day 18 - Tokyo, leave 5pm * I had a decent amount of day before my flight and just wanted a relaxing day * I decided to just go to Ueno park and maybe the zoo. The park was nice, but the zoo was not so good. Many of the enclosures were barren or too small for their animals, so it was really sad. And I would have like to see the pandas, but they had two enclosures, both an hour wait when I walked in there pretty close after opening. * Lunch - Sushiro (skihabara) conveyer belt sushi place. Pretty good"}

Group of 4 adults 2 kids. I was the only person in the group who studied some Japanese, culture and put phrases together for others. Provided guidance to the group. Going to just start with the bumps along the road and then summarize our days. The bumps are by far the most interesting part of the trip. There was one ramen place that was an interesting experience. It was a one man shop, keep in mind empty seats, we were the only customers @ 5pm, we are figuring out the ticket system but get it to work quickly. Before we sit down the ramen guy literally hawks a loogie, one in our group members mentioned the cook bent down and spat. Might have been on the ground/trash or might have been on our food, who knows. I was like super confused as to what to think after hearing it. We had already paid and I assumed no ill intention. But maybe a sign of disrespect. Sometimes you got to clear the throat, I guess? He was quiet and no verbal welcome (Maybe this is normal). Maybe we were a little chatty when figuring out the system and the cook was annoyed? Kids ordered dumplings and maybe they should have gotten full bowls, but he wouldn‚Äôt have known what we ordered until he saw our tickets. In case you all want to know what the place is called ‚ÄúYokohamakakeiramen Haruki Aomonoyokochoten‚Äù in Shinagawa. The vibe felt off but we still ate the fucking ramen lol and bounced asap. It tasted good, nothing out of the ordinary just decent ramen. I left feeling confused. In one of the Airbnb‚Äôs we stayed in, we were heading inside the home and an older gentleman looked over at us, staring. I do a slight bow and say ‚ÄúKonichiwa‚Äù he turns away scoffs and waves his hand back. Almost like a ‚ÄúFuck off tourist‚Äù gesture. I close the door and think about it for a minute. When at universal the staff engagement is obviously a forced kindness as they wave and clap for you before and after the rides. It honestly felt weird, but I played along because life is awesome but deep down I know they are just tired journeying thru life like everyone else. While I greeted, thanked, ordered in Japanese, asked in Japanese and tried to utilize the language as much as possible there were just times where I had to pull Google translate and type in what I needed but I could feel a slight frustration or uneasiness on their part in some situations. Understandably so. Japanese folks are getting tourist fatigue and resentful of traveling tourists. I actually expected this based on so many recent posts. I was also keeping an eye out for shoulder checkers lol. It‚Äôs sad but I embraced the reality. Anyways, below is a short timeline of our beautiful adventure in Japan. 1st day/night, stayed in Narita. Glad we stayed here after flying in, we were tired and needed to stay up as much as we could without having to worry about traveling on a train as soon as we arrived to NRT. We ate conbini food for the first time, it was okay but nothing great. 2nd-4th day/night. First time figuring out public transportation, we are Americans that drive everywhere. I figured it out but initially I was lost as to where to go physically. Not understanding the flow of transferring to other transportation lines. Google maps was helpful but less so when actually going thru the underground pathways and the exits were not always accurate on the app because of poor service. I used Aerolo as my eSIM and it was okay. Actually, it sucked. So spend extra on a better eSIM. Spent these next three nights in Kyoto, Gion district and it was awesome. Being jet lagged allowed us to be ready early in the morning and beat the crowds to popular shrines and temples. No restaurant reservations or plans made, just ate what we saw on the street and explored by foot. Legs were really sore by the 3rd day and kids championed right thru. 5th-6th day/night. Went to universal studios 1.5 days, 4 ride express pass with Nintendo World time entry. We were able to get into Nintendo early on the 2nd day without timed entry by being in line two hours before park opening. We beat the crowds and headed straight for the Donkey Kong ride which we did not have an express pass for. Got on all the rides we wanted and rode some rides twice which was great. 7th day/night. Stayed in an Airbnb with a private onsen in Atami, Izu penninsula. It was a beautiful traditional Japanese home with a modern touch. Soaked in the onsen while having local sake, ate at an eel place that was delicious. Walked around the market place and got bit by mosquitoes from hell. 8th-10th day/night. Rented a car in Atami and drove down to Shimoda in the pouring rain to an Airbnb. The views were amazing, lush forestry with mountainous terrain. Stayed in Shimoda 3 nights. Enjoyed driving on the opposite side of the road on much more narrow vehicle lanes than we are use to. I loved Shimoda, spent days exploring beaches and eating at local restaurants with fresh seafood. By far my favorite place and less tourists at this time of the year. 11th-12th day/night. Spent the day traveling from Shimoda to Shinagawa, checked in the hotel went out into Tokyo, Shibuya region. Ate and shopped and said hello to Hachiko. Overall a raw experience, mostly good and some things to reflect on. For all new future travelers please do some homework before coming to Japan. Don‚Äôt be an ignorant tourist, the temperature is rising and I don‚Äôt mean the weather. Happy travels."}

I have already been in Japan twice 20 years ago, so I already had an idea about what I wanted to do and show to my family, and I know to speak bit of japanese, which indeed helped us to have real conversations with locals. So here was our itinerary: \\-Tokyo (4 nights in an AirBnB/ 3,5 days) : Nihonbahsi with Pokemon Caf√©, Shibuya, Asakusa, Akihabara (with Cat Caf√©), Ninja Tokyo restaurant, Odaiba (with TeamLabs Planets), Shinjuku * Kids loved Pokemon Caf√©, everything is cute, and I actually find the food was okay, and not as terrible as some reviews says. It was the highlight of my 3 years old who keeps talking to me about it! * Akihabara is not that interesting if you don't plan to do some shopping. Yes, the district is all about video games and anime, but I don't find anything expect shoping. I think that for all anime lovers, Ikebukuro is more interesting as there are more to see (even cosplay) * To my surprise the kids show real interest in visiting the temples, all along the travel * Ninja Tokyo restaurant is awesome : not only the decor is amazing, the show is good, but the food is as very good! I had there the best meat I ever ate in my life (Omi-Sawai Beef). We ate during the rest of our stay in some meat/grill restaurants, and the wagyu was not as good as this one . I remember reading some reviews saying it is a tourist-trap, and I could not disagree more. It is indeed expensive, but totaly worth it! * TeamLab Planets is awesome, and the kids loved it! It is very visual and interactive. * Concerning using the subways with kids : we traveled with a foldable stroller, and even if we had some difficulties at first, we did OK when we see it was always possible to find an elevator, even if it means sometime going to the other side of the station. So it is totally OK to travel with a stroller in the subways, but avoid the rush hours and prepare to walk a lot in the stations. We needed to fold the stroller only for long distance train, and in the restaurants. \\-Hakone (2 nights in a ryokan / 1.5 day): Owakudani valley, Ashi Lake, Hakone jinja, onsens! * Hakone is nice, the Hakone sanctuary is one my favourite, but don't go in Hakone just to visit Hakone or you will miss the most important. If you come to Hakone, stay in a ryokan with onsens! More generally, I will recommand that if you comme to Japan, you HAVE to stay few nights in a ryokan in an onsen city. It can be Hakone, or another city (there are a lot of onsens city all across Japan). Those 2 nights in our ryokan, with the kids wearing yukatas, the excellent food, and of course the private indoor and outdoor baths, was (with Okinawa) the highlight of our trip. * In our ryokan, the food was not traditional kaiseki meal, but more \"deluxe\" family food (like tepanyaki and shabu-shabu), and I think it was for the best with our kids. I read an article about this, mentionning that less and less ryokans propose kaiskei food because foreigner visitors don't like it, and finally go outside the ryokan to eat another restaurant instead. I can understand that, I tried kaiseki during my first trip to Japan, and it it not for everybody. So I will recommend that if you book a ryokan with evening meal, check what type of food is proposed, especially if you travel with kids. \\-Kyoto (4 nights in an AirBnB / 3.5 days): Kioymizu-dera and Gion, Arahiyama (Monkey Park Iwatayama, Tenryu-ji), Nara, Universal Studio Japan, Ramen factory cooking course * Arashiyma is just so beautiful! * Kyoto is not as animated as Tokyo. It is hard to find restaurants open after 9;00 pm * The subway of Kyoto is OK, some lines are actyally quite classy (the Hankuy line!) but there are very few! You will need to take the bus if you need to go to certain points in Kyoto, and the bus are very crowded! That's where the foldable stroller become mandatory * Universal Studio Japan is nice but expensive if you want to enjoy it fully. We did pay the Express Pass, and we didn't regret it when we saw the huge queues for each attractions. I think it would have been a real pain without the Pass. Globally, I found the decors absolutely gorgeous, but I was not impressed by the rides (except Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, and the Flying Dinosaurs). * The ramen cooking course (Ramen Factory) was excellent. Everybody enjoyed it, I actuallt learned some tricks to be able to do ramen on my own, and it was finally the best ramens we ate during our journey! \\-Okinawa (1 night in an AirBnB on the main island, 2 nights in a minshuku on Zamami island): visit the Okinawa Churaumi aquarium, take the ferry to Zamami island, Kayak and snorkeling on Zamami. * Okinawa Churaumi aquarium is awesome, especially the dolphin show, and the incredible Kuroshio tank * I stay only one day on the main island, but here is my quick take on Okinawa : Okinawa is very different from Japan \"main land\" on many aspects. I think the architecture/house/garden are not as beautiful as the traditional Japan (Naha, the main city, is not very beautiful to be honest), but is it more wild. People also tends to be less polite, more direct, but warmer if you discuss with them. So it may not appeal to everybody. * In my opinion, the biggest interest of Okinawa is its small islands. There are a lot of them famous for their stunning scenery and diving spots. * We stayed 2 nights on the Zamami island (1 hour in ferry from Naha), and this was the best moment of our travel (with the onsen ryokan in Hakone). Walk on a dreamly beach, swim and dive surounded by dozens of multi-colored fished, in front of the beautiful island cover by wild forest... This was heaven on earth, those days will stay forever stuck in our mind. We would rather have stayed 1 or 2 more additional days there. So to sum up : traveling to Japan with kids (even small ones) is OK as long as you are prepared, there are many activities that can be enjoyed by the whole family, spend few nights in a ryokan in onsen city, and spend few days on one of the small beautiful islands of Okinawa!"}

I \\[24M\\] went to Hokkaido in July 11-22, 2023, with my brother \\[22M\\], and mother \\[58F\\]. We relied heavily on public transport as we don't drive. Also, it was our very first trip to Japan. We come from a country where there is not a lot of nature, so please understand that is the context I am writing from. Perhaps, if you hail from a country that is blessed with much nature, my reviews of the places below may differ from yours! XD Hope that this would be of some help to those who are planning a trip there in the summer :). |Place visited|Accessibility/Worth it?|Additional comments| |:-|:-|:-| |Tomita Farm\\*|Accessible via JR, and then a short walk. Really worth it, as it was peak lavender season. Enjoyed lavender ice cream and just walking around and admiring the flowers with my family|Please go only during the bloom periods or risk huge disappointment. You can double check via research online, but to the best of my knowledge and experience there, peak bloom is usually mid - end july. Blooming usually starts from end june - end july (so worth going anytime here)| |Shikisai No Oka|Not as accessible, but my family alighted at Bibaushi JR and walked the remaining 3km. If you are a flower lover/nature lover, it's absolutely worth it :) during blooming season. They arrange the colours so beautifully and with the rolling hills of Biei as the backdrop, it is simply breathtaking|Please go only during the bloom periods or risk huge disappointment. You can double check via research online, but to the best of my knowledge and experience there, bloom is usually mid july - september| |Hokuryo Sunflower Village|Very inaccessible. Had to go to Fukugawa JR and then take a taxi in. But my mum loves sunflowers so we went! Although it was not the peak season, we still managed to see about \\~100000- 200000 sunflowers in the maze area. So we still enjoyed ourselves alot. During peak season, 2 million sunflowers are in bloom|Please go only during the bloom periods or risk huge disappointment. Peak season is usually in early - mid august. Please research online for the Hokuryo sunflower festival before deciding whether to go.| |Otaru\\*|Very accessible, especially if coming from Sapporo. Absolutely lovely imo. Loved the canal, loved the chill vibes, loved the fresh seafood|May want to consider staying a night here. Really loved the \"magical\" vibes of the town.| |Blue pond/Shirahige waterfalls|Not very accessible. In fact, my airbnb host kindly drove my family here FOC. Blue pond is famous for being one of Apple's used wallpapers few years back! I think it was beautiful, but not a MUST VISIT. Shirahige was nice, but also not a MUST VISIT|There is a public bus that brings you to the vicinity but even then you would still have to walk a distance. Multiple YT videos showing how to access via public bus| |Campana Rokkatei|Accessible via Gakuden JR and a beautiful 2km walk in. Very underrated, very beautiful. Really nice enjoying desserts at their cafe and seeing the mountain ranges behind. There is a genghis khan restaurant next to it plus a small museum FOC. You can walk around (but not into) the vineyards too!|I recommended this place to a friend, and his family remarked that it was really underrated and a core memory of their trip! If you love desserts, nature and chill vibes, do come here!| |Lake Toya\\*|Can't comment on accessibility here, as our hotel at lake toya provided free transfer from sapporo JR station. Really beautiful lake, did some running here, caught the sunrise, and alot of onsen. Had a meal in the hotel restaurant with large windows overlooking the lake, and it was really nice. Chill vibes all around. Loved it|Fireworks every night too (please do check the schedule still before going). If you book accomodation/hotels there, try to find those that provide free transfers. Try to request a room with a lake view, it will be incredible. Recommend max 2 night stay as that is enough to explore the lake and Mt Usuzan Ropeway| |Mt Usuzan Ropeway|Took a public bus there from a bustop near our hotel (Lake Toya area). While it was beautiful, I don't think it is a MUST VISIT. I would say you can consider visiting here only if you are already in the Lake Toya vicinity|Genuinely not a MUST DO activity imo| Sapporo vibes: City vibes, but definitely less crowded than osaka/kyoto/tokyo. Was nice just walking around, shopping and trying random eateries/restaurants Asahikawa vibes: Definitely less crowded than Sapporo. Gave me \"residential\" vibes, in the sense that it is a good city to live in :). The train station architecture was beautiful. My family had one of our favoritest bowls of soba here for JPY400 in a random shop. Biei Town vibes: Very chill. Very quiet town. Nice place to find solitude. We stayed here in an airbnb for a sizeable portion of our trip Furano Town vibes: Quiet town but not as quiet as Biei. Quite developed and loved that there were mountains in the backdrop. Had one of our most favorite okonomiyaki and sashimi bowls in this town. We accessed it via Furano JR station. Tips: \\- If relying heavily on public transport, you may want to consider this JR regional pass, called the Sapporo-Furano Area Pass (https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361\\_furano.html). Trains are not the cheapest in Japan, and we paid for all our tickets seperately back then (when we could have saved JPY7000 each). Please do countercheck against Jorudan or any other reliable website to see if you would have cost savings from this JR Pass before purchasing \\- Genuinely only visit the flower fields during peak season. Can't stress this enough, many people have been left disappointed by the lack of blooms (basically just empty patches out of peak season) \\- I also asterisked the places above which are MUST DOs imo when visiting in the summer. Please take it with a pinch of salt. \\- Was recommended by a friend to visit Mitsui Outlet Park, Sapporo Kitahiroshima. We did so and the prices there were hard to beat. Things like running shoes, sportwear brands were all priced lower than any of the prices we saw at ABC mart, Shopping arcades etc in Sapporo Have a safe and fun trip and enjoy! Feel free to ask any questions below :D"}

My husband and I just returned from our trip to Tokyo and I have wanted to share my trip report. I was 23 weeks pregnant on the trip and I hope this post may be helpful for any future travelers thinking about Tokyo who are also expecting a baby :) Day 1: We flew from Seattle to Haneda Airport and arrived at ~2 PM. Customs was quite quick and took us 30 minutes in total, albeit most of that time was spent rapidly walking through the VERY long lines. Afterwards, I directly downloaded the Welcome Suica and Airalo 10GB plan while we were still at the airport. The 10GB may have been overkill but I was determined to use Google Maps for all of my navigating and also wanted to use the Papago app for translation purposes. We then Ubered to our hotel as I was a little tired and didn't want to navigate the rail system quite yet. We each packed a duffel bag with enough clothes for 4 days. I also chose a hotel which provided a washer/dryer for guest use because frankly I don't like carrying luggage around and neither of us was planning on buying a lot. We did some exploring in Ueno Park after checking in to the hotel and went to the 7-11 near by to withdraw currency. Day 2: I had contacted a volunteer guide group about 2 weeks before our trip. I think the concept of these is awesome and I enjoyed the experience of hanging out with someone who was very confident in their knowledge of the neighborhoods. We used the SGG Goodwill Guides Group, which primarily connects multilingual retired Japanese folks to interested foreign travelers. The group's participants can spend a max of 3 days with the travelers and it is expected that the travelers cover the cost of transportation and lunch. They don't generally like larger groups so I would only opt for the volunteer guide option if you're in a party of 4ish or less. You are required to fill out an application at least 2 weeks ahead of your travel date and specify what you would like to see. Afterwards, the group circulates the application amongst its members and matches you with a volunteer. Our guide Ken was about 70, originally from the Kansai region, super fit, and worked on Wall Street for about 15 years in his youth before heading back to Japan. He met us at our hotel and we spent nearly the whole day with him and parted ways at ~4:30 PM. I had previously expressed in my application form that I was interested in seeing Shinto shrines, Buddhist temples, and smaller gardens in the Asakusa and Ueno neighborhoods so we did a lot of exploring there, including the Senso-Ji temple. Ken and my husband are both into trading market so they had a good time chatting about the state of American and Japanese stock markets. He was super pleasant to talk to and we ended up discussing everything from corporate culture in Japan vs America, Japanese Shinto practices, kabuki and Noh performances, the differences between the healthcare systems of both countries, and even some more spicy political topics that he brought up himself lol. We went to a lot of smaller gardens where nearly all of the visitors were middle aged to elderly Japanese people and zero tourists. Ken was nice enough to help us get tickets. He brought a guide badge so that his tickets were generally free (but FYI you are also expected to cover your guides ticket costs if they don't have one for some reason). I highly highly recommend volunteer guide groups with retirees! Day 3-8: We explored Shinjuku, Shibuya, more of Ginza (specifically the Seiko museum and surrounding areas) Kanda, Shimokitazawa, Koenji, Roppongi, Jinbocho book town, more of Ueno/Asakusa, and briefly stopped in Akhibara. We did not go to Tokyo Tower or Shibuya scramble but did see Meiji Shrine. Some of the highlights: * Meeting a group of drunk businessmen at an outdoor izakaya on Ameyoko market street in Ueno. Basically, one of them randomly tapped me in the shoulder and handed me these packaged cheese snacks and said \"I love you\" very enthusiastically. We thought this was hilarious so we bought them shots. Afterwards, I found out that two in their group spoke really great English and Spanish respectively so we spent a few hours chatting about work, politics, and even one of their upcoming divorces lol üòÇ I didn't think I was going to have full blown conversations with people in Japan in Spanish but hey, life is funny that way. The owner bought my husband multiple drinks and chatted with us a bit (and apologized for some of the more crazy members of the group). Apparently they were the owners friends and came to that spot regularly. Overall we had a lot of fun with them. Please check out this market street! Yes, it's \"touristy\" but it's also crammed with cool local spots and such a fun vibe. * S Watanabe woodcut prints in Ginza. This is the real deal. I didn't realize this when we walked in but the Watanabe family has been in the business of ukiyo-e for a long time and the service at this shop was excellent. They have lots of originals and prints reaching as far back as the Edo period. I had a little bit of an awkward encounter here (see my post history) but the experience was excellent overall. My parents are serious art and handicraft collectors so I will direct them here if/when they decide to take a trip. * Suntory Museum of Art in the Tokyo Midtown complex in Ginza. This was another experience I walked into without much knowledge ahead of time but I'm glad I did! We walked through an art exhibit featuring scrolls dating from the 1400s depicting the tale of Shutend≈çji, a legendary Japanese demon and human flesh eater who is destroyed by a brave group of men. I believe that some of the scrolls on display have never been available for the public prior to this installation. The exhibition is very artfully designed and even comes with an extremely detailed audio guide that builds anticipation for the story as you walk through the museum hallways. Tokyo Midtown is an extremely aesthetic and luxurious indoor area with plenty of benches. It was especially hot on the day we came here so it was a nice break. * Every Swing Jazz Club in Ueno! This was such a cool spot. Every patron (except for us) was actually a rotating performer and seemed to be friends going back a long time. They were all probs in their 60s and older. We paid a cover charge and bought some snacks/drinks and listened as this cool group of friends played a bunch of different jazz standards. A few people spoke a little English so they initiated a conversation with us after I explained in that my husband was in a jazz band. The bartender busted out the star spangled banner on his trumpet after he found out that we were American üòÇ * Jazz Spot Intro in Shinjuku! Very different/younger vibe than the previous place. The talent here is extraordinary and we happened to stumble in on a night when a world class saxophonist and composer was playing. We met a bunch of locals and tourists alike, including a drummer from Osaka who played a few sets, and had a blast. This is a VERY tiny bar and they have no problems cramming people in so be warned if you're a claustrophobic jazz head. The owner knows how to run a tight ship but keeps the atmosphere energetic and fun. * Yoyogi Park in Shibuya was great! There was a big food fest AND a Lao festival while we were there. We even got to see a Japanese punk band perform on an outdoor stage for free which was cool. Ueno Park is a close second for me. * YAYOI KUSAMA Museum! This is a small but interesting modern collection from an extremely successful artist. Some of her displays are interactive so it was a nice change of pace from the typical art museum. * standing room only neighborhood bar in Koenji. I had a strong feeling that it was frequented by a small group of regulars who all knew eachother so we tried not to be buzzkills. We dropped a lot of money here and eventually chatted a lot with the bartender and some patrons with a mix of broken Japanese and Papago. One regular who was a fluent English speaker talked to us a lot and mentioned that he wanted to visit our home state in the US so we exchanged emails and may take him paddle boarding at some point in the future. Koenji was one of my favorite neighborhoods! General Tips: * I highly recommend getting a Welcome Suica and topping it off as you go with Apple Pay. It's extremely convenient and compatible with multiple railway lines. We were frequently at the train station during rush hours so being able to tap and go instantly was great! Also my iPhone ran out of battery once before I left a train station but to my relief the fare amount was still deducted when I tapped my phone. * Airalo eSIM was also a lifesaver, especially with how much we relied on Apple Maps for walking directions. * Getting the ChatGPT app was great for translating handwritten menus/information from Japanese to English. This helped us a lot with eating at places which did not have an English menu and for using appliances at the hotel. * Get some solid and comfy shoes for walking. We were hitting 20k-30k steps per day and it was frequently close to 80 F outside for multiple days of the trip. * Try to learn a few phrases of Japanese while you are here (please, thanks, excuse me, x number of people, how much is this, this please, etc). This isn't Paris; people aren't going to sneer at you for trying. The Papago app is also amazing for inserting a natural-sounded translated sentence if you're struggling with something. * Bring your own small container of handsoap if you are planning on visiting large parks or gardens. Many of the restrooms at these locations do NOT have soap at the sinks. This also applies to train station bathroom sometimes. * Carry your passport with you at all times. This is the law for foreign non-residents of Japan. * Pay attention to your surroundings and try to mirror what others are doing: - Line up for the train the proper way and let other people out before you head inside. Keep your voice volume at the same amount as others while in public. Don't talk on your phone on the train!!! - If you can avoid it, do not bring your 100 suitcases onto the busy platforms during rush hours. There are busy people going to work and doing this takes up space and annoys others. Consider using luggage forwarding. - Do not randomly stop walking while you are on the street to stare at your phone. I saw a shocking number of people doing this even in very narrow yokochos with their giant backpacks, especially middle aged tourists who should know better. The Millennials were more guilty of stopping to take selfies which was also rude imho. If you need to stop to consult your phone, please step away to an area where you will not disrupt others. * Take your trash with you; it's not acceptable to dump it at the nearest konbini. Many of the drink/ice cream vending machines at the train platforms have recycling bins right next to them that appeared to be emptied regularly. Take advantage of this! I would opt for selecting a drink and finishing it at these locations. Pregnancy specific tips: * It goes without saying but please discuss your upcoming trip with your physician to get specific advice on what you can/cannot eat and participate in if you are unsure. My OBGYN happens to be Japanese-American with close ties to the area (speaks Japanese, has Japanese patients, frequently visits family in the country) and was ok with me consuming raw fish provided that it was restaurant food in Japan. She did not want me dunking my entire body in onsen water and told me to save any kimono photo shoots for a postpartum trip as she was cautious about how tight obi sashes are tied. I am pretty fit but I have low blood pressure (90s/60s) so this advice is specific for ME and may not apply to you. * Consider compression socks and multiple pairs of shoes for max foot and leg comfort. Compression socks can also help prevent DVTs if you are flying for a long time. * If you are accompanying drinking family members/friends on a trip, please order teas or nonalcoholic mocktails with snacks and food as you stop at bars and izakayas. Some of these locations rely on small groups of regulars to survive, a group of tourists with nondrinking members can be troublesome. * I don't recommend traveling to Tokyo during the summer (after May) if you're pregnant. The heat and humidity can get pretty intense and there were a few days on our trip where we headed back to our hotel with Pocari Sweat to chill (literally) in the mid afternoon. * Some people here and on the other sub have discussed those \"pregnancy badges\" as a helpful aide for getting the priority seats on the train. IMHO this seemed to be pointless based on my observations. The priority seats filled up every time during busy hours and people dont GAF. * Some people find themselves getting constipated on trips to Japan as the restaurant food we foreign visitors frequently consume on vacation isn't always very rich in fiber. Our hotel did not have a restaurant/breakfast provided so I purchased fresh fruit and veggie salads at konbinis and the outdoor markets. I also ordered meal sets with salads and veggie soups. The quality of fruit at the konbinis was surprisingly excellent. Things I wish I had done: - Booked kabuki tickets well in advance online. I was angling to get a single act ticket online for the Kabukiza Theater in Ginza but the shows were extremely popular during the week that we were there so the single-acts got snatched up pretty quickly. They are not released until noon the day before a performance but you're also competing for them with people who show up extremely early to the ticket box in person. - Booked sumo tickets as soon as we bought airline tickets. These also sell out rather quickly and can go several months in advance of the events. While checking the calendar I saw that a lot of dates in December were already full ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è - Learned more Japanese before my trip! Meeting Japanese people who were confident in their English was cool but we would like to travel to areas besides Tokyo/big cities during future travels. I would like to make it a goal to be much more conversational the next time around. I hope this was helpful to someone!"}
